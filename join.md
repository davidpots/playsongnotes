## Membership is offered through Patreon.com

I offer membership directly through **Patreon.com**, which is a membership platform used by over 250,000 creators (myself included). This allows you, for a small monthly (or annual) pledge, to support my efforts directly. In return, you get access to the premium items listed below. You can cancel your membership anytime! Membership is month by month, with annual plans also available (which save you ~15%).

## Is membership required?

No! I make plenty of free content. After 20+ years of being a self-taught guitarist, it's my absolute joy to freely share with y'all so many of the things I've learned in that time. My free offerings:

- **Over 400+ Video Lessons on YouTube** - I've been posting to YouTube since 2013, releasing about one video each week. Sometimes I teach songs, while other times I explain techniques, quick riffs, or practical music theory. If you're curious to check out my videos, you can do that on my YouTube channel ‚Äì or alternatively use this website to browse everything.

- **My FretMonster Web Tool** - One of the reasons to bookmark my website is so you can use FretMonster, which is an interactive fretboard tool I built a few years ago. This visualizes the guitar fretboard in a way that makes it easy to "see" things like notes, intervals, chord shapes, scales, and more. I'm happy to make this available to everyone at no extra charge!

- **My Weekly Email Newsletter** - Want to stay in the loop with my lessons, at no cost? Sign up for my free email newsletter. I write a post every week or two, sharing links to whatever it is I've been working on. Video lesson, new song sheets, instructional PDFs, backing tracks, and more -- you'll be sure to hear about it in the newsletter.

<br />
## What do members get?

In addition to everything I offer for free, I've spent a few years building up a library of premium content as well. This includes print-friendly guides, members-only videos, backing tracks, and more -- all of which help you accelerate your learning and deepen your understanding of each topic. Premium content includes:

- **50% Discount on Licensed Song Sheets** - whenever I teach a new song, I'll write up a print-friendly song sheet to accompany my video. These are exclusively available for sale at Musicnotes.com, who provides licensing to ensure the songwriters are fairly paid. Patreon members save 50% on each purchase with a discount code I make available each month. _Note, membership isn't required to buy my song sheets._

- **Access to All My Instructional PDFs** - when I make videos teaching guitar techniques, practice exercises, music theory, or similar topics ‚Äì¬†I'll release a print-friendly PDF to accompany that lesson. These are helpful visual aids to help you follow along via tabs, fretboard diagrams, strumming patterns, etc. These can all be downloaded and kept by you forever, even after your membership ends.

- **Backing Tracks & Members-Only Videos** - Periodically, I'll release members-only video and/or audio files to accompany my free lessons. This can include full-song play-along videos, audio backing tracks, or members-only Q&A updates.

- **Access to the Song Notes Community** - Each time I post a new update, Song Notes members are able to comment & join the discussion on each post. Members are also able to contact me directly (I prioritize responding to these messages above non-member feedback).

<br />
## What happens after I become a member?

- **As soon as you sign up,** you get immediate access to all premium content I've made in the past. You can easily search my lessons to find exactly what you're looking for.

- **You'll get an email each week** with each new lesson I create. This makes it easy to stay in the loop with the latest premium content I release.

- **You can cancel anytime** - there's no commitment at all. Canceling takes less than a minute! You get to keep all instructional PDFs you've downloaded.

<br />
## What does membership cost?

Membership begins at $5/month (USD), or you can save ~15% if you make an annual pledge. You're charged at the time of sign up, and monthly members are charged again on the 1st of each month.

<br />
## What if I'm not happy?

Again, you can cancel anytime -- and I'm also happy to issue a refund if for whatever reason you realize membership isn't for you!

## What members are saying

<p class="testimonial">You have the very best tabs on the net! Easy to follow, logically designed, complete with all information. That's why I'm a supporter!<br /><br />‚Äì Jimbo</p>

<p class="testimonial">Thank you David for the most excellent guitar lessons. I am getting old now and my guitar is a new and awesome instrument that gives me peace in our troubled world. Your contribution and dedication to your lessons provides me with hours of learning in an easy fun style. I am blessed to have been able to support you on Patreon and have access to everything you put out there.<br /><br />‚Äì Harvey</p>

<p class="testimonial">I've seen more guitar instructional videos on the web than I can count but but no one does a better job of explaining and simplifying a song as you do, with the added bonus of a downloadable PDFs. I just got back into playing acoustic guitar last year after a hiatus of too many decades. Keep up the good work you do for all us beginners, re-beginners and not so beginners.<br /><br />‚Äì David</p>

<p class="testimonial">Thank you üôè you are a wonderful teacher as well as a fabulous musician not often do you get both in the same package.<br /><br />‚Äì Eileen</p>

<p class="testimonial">I have just picked up the guitar after 30 years of saying 'I would love to learn that'. Out of all the lessons I have come across online yours are the best. You have a way of making the song sound close to the original and making it pretty easy to learn as a beginner to learn. I could not keep watching the lessons without donating something because learning the guitar takes time and devotion. You deserve to get something back for all you put in. I have subscribed to your channel, and I have never subscribed to anything online. I wish you all the best and hope you have continued success.<br /><br />‚Äì Joshauh</p>

<p class="testimonial">I enjoy your lessons and teaching style. They are practical and I love that you break things down in an easy to understand way. Also your lessons are fun! :) I'm a happy supporter and thank you for providing great service and your musical gift.<br /><br />‚Äì Tangie</p>

<p class="testimonial">I‚Äôve tinkered with the guitar since I was a teenager but never really committed to practicing it. I could never find the passion or the structure from a teacher to keep me at it. I have a full time job and kids...and life is busy. Almost two years ago, I broke my ankle playing baseball and dusted off the guitar. I stumbled across your lesson Say It Ain‚Äôt So by Weezer. I was completely sold. I decided to become a patreon supporter of yours. Tonight, I was just completely compelled to send you a message. Your lessons, teaching, PDF‚Äôs...you name it...Are pure quality. You come across as passionate about your work and it truly makes a difference. Anyway. I hope you and your family are staying healthy and safe during these times. I wish you all best. Thank you for the lessons and I also hope that your site becomes so successful that you can just do this full time. No response necessary. Just reaching out to say I wish lots of good karma to go your way! Cheers!<br /><br />‚Äì Jason</p>

<p class="testimonial">You are such an amazing teacher! You describe steps in detail that is so necessary for beginners like me. Thank you for all that you do!<br /><br />‚Äì Cara</p>

<p class="testimonial">Man, you're the best out there and the way you break things down with printables along with the different camera angles helps me in ways I can't put into words. It's truly a pleasure to be a Patreon supporter of yours!<br /><br />‚Äì BB</p>

<p class="testimonial">You are the very best on the web for teaching how to play a particular song down to the details that deliver a truly professional sounding version. I love it!<br /><br />‚Äì Nick</p>
