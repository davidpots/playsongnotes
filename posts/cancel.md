# How to cancel Patreon membership

I unfortunately can't cancel for you -- Patreon doesn't give me that ability. But, it's easy enough for you to do! Here's the steps:

1. Log in to [patreon.com](https://patreon.com)
2. Hover over to your profile image (in the top right corner) to open the user menu.
3. Click on "Manage Memberships" from the menu.
4. Click the "Edit" link next to the membership you want to cancel.
5. You'll land on the familiar payment confirmation page. Scroll down and click the "Edit or Cancel Payment" link directly under the “update” button.
6. Select the option to "Edit or Cancel Payment".
7. Click the "Cancel" button to confirm.

For more details about canceling, [visit this page](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005502572-How-to-cancel-a-Patreon-membership) on Patreon's Help Center. It answers various specific questions regarding billing, accessing content after you cancel, etc.

Thanks for the support, good luck, and all the best!
