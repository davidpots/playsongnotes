<h2>General questions</h2>

<div class="question-wrapper">
  <h3 class="question-heading">How do I search your lessons?</h3>
  <div class="question-body">
    <p>Please bookmark my official website <a href="https://playsongnotes.com">playsongnotes.com</a> and use that to search. Patreon's search feature (which I don't control) isn't great for sifting through the 350+ lessons I've created. Instead, my official website is much better suited for this task. You can browse lessons by topic, category, genre, etc.</p>

<div class="question-wrapper">
  <h3 class="question-heading">How do I access your PDFs?</h3>
  <div class="question-body">
    <p>There are two types of PDFs I make, and you get them in different ways.</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Song Sheet Music</strong> - which teach full songs, including lyrics/chords/tabs/etc – are available for individual purchase via Musicnotes.com. Each song sheet is licensed (thanks to Musicnotes), ensuring the songwriters are getting a portion of each purchase. You can use this website (playsongnotes.com) to search all my song lessons, which link out to the Musicnotes page where you can purchase them. Or, you can view my Musicnotes profile page <a href="https://www.musicnotes.com/sheet-music/artist/song-notes-by-david-pots">here</a>.<br /><br /></li>
    <li><strong>Instructional PDFs (non-songs)</strong> – which teach techniques, licks & riffs, warm-up exercises, and music theory – are all available to active supporters via my Patreon page. Whether you support me monthly or annually, you get access to all of these PDFs. Use this website (playsongnotes.com) to search my lessons, each of which links out to the Patreon page where you can download the PDF.</li>
    </ol>

<div class="question-wrapper">
  <h3 class="question-heading">Do you offer 1:1 private lessons?</h3>
  <div class="question-body">Unfortunately, I don't offer 1:1 private lessons (in person, or over Zoom). At the moment I don't have any plans to start offering them.</div>
</div>
<div class="question-wrapper">
  <h3 class="question-heading">What guitar, pick, and gear do you use?</h3>
  <div class="question-body">I've had a Taylor 310 since 2001, which has been my only guitar up until 2020 (when I finally added a Taylor GS Mini, with a Koa finish). For more info on my guitar, my pick of choice, and the other gear I use -- <a href="/lessons/369/">see this post</a> where I go over everything in detail.</div>
</div>
<div class="question-wrapper">
  <h3 class="question-heading">I need help with printing...</h3>
  <div class="question-body">
    <p>Check out my <a href="/printing">printing help page</a> for a few common tips.</p>
    <p>If you need help with printing a Musicnotes purchase, please visit the <a href="https://help.musicnotes.com/hc/en-us">Musicnotes Help Center</a> -- they have an extensive library of help pages to assist you. Similar to Patreon, they're a large company with a dedicated support staff who can help you out directly.</p>

<h2>About Patreon...</h2>

<div class="question-wrapper">
  <h3 class="question-heading">Why are't your song sheets on Patreon anymore?</h3>
  <div class="question-body">
    <p>In May 2021, I moved my "song" PDFs from Patreon to Musicnotes, where they'll be properly licensed and abide by copyright laws. <a href="/copyright">Please see this page</a> for more details on this topic.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="question-wrapper">
  <h3 class="question-heading">How do I cancel my Patreon membership?</h3>
  <div class="question-body"><a href="/cancel">Here's a page showing how to cancel</a> - it only takes a minute. Note, I can't cancel for you (they literally don't give me that ability).</div>
</div>
<div class="question-wrapper">
  <h3 class="question-heading">I have a question about Patreon account...</h3>
  <div class="question-body">
    <p>If you need help with Patreon, please take a look at the <a href="https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us">Patreon Help Center</a> -- as there's tons of detailed posts there addressing the most common requests: login issues, payment issues, how to cancel your account, etc.</p>
    <p>If you're stuck with something, start off by <a href="https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000465611">emailing Patreon support directly</a> -- as that's usually the best way to make sure things are resolved. Patreon is a large company with a dedicated support staff -- and they will be back in touch to help solve your problem.</p>
