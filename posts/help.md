## General questions

<div class="question-wrapper">
  <h3 class="question-heading">How do I search your lessons?</h3>
  <div class="question-body">
    <p>Please bookmark my website <a href="https://playsongnotes.com">playsongnotes.com</a> and use that to search. Patreon's search feature (which I don't control) isn't great for sifting through the 350+ lessons I've created. Instead, my website is much better suited for this task. You can browse lessons by topic, category, genre, etc.</p>

<div class="question-wrapper">
  <h3 class="question-heading">Do you offer 1:1 private lessons?</h3>
  <div class="question-body">Unfortunately, I don't offer 1:1 private lessons (in person, or over Zoom). At the moment I don't have any plans to start offering them.</div>
