# Help and Frequently Asked Questions

Here's answers to the most common questions I receive. If you're stuck on something, please give this page a skim, in hopes the answer you seek is already typed out below. If you're still stumped, you can [email me](/contact) -- but note it may take me a few hours (or more) to reply -- so be sure you've checked below for answers first.

## FAQ

### How do I search your lessons?

Please bookmark my website <strong>[playsongnotes.com](https://playsongnotes.com)</strong> and use that to search. Patreon's search feature (which I don't control) isn't great for sifting through the 350+ lessons I've created. Instead, my website is much better suited for this task. You can browse lessons by topic, category, genre, etc.

### How do I get the current 50%-off discount code for Musicnotes...

You can always find the current month's discount code [at this link](/discount). The code is updated on the 1st of each month, and can be used unlimited times. Note, this code is only available to current Patreon members ([here's how to join](/join)).

### I want to cancel my Patreon membership...

[Here's a page showing how to cancel](/cancel) - it only takes a minute. Note, I can't cancel for you (they literally don't give me that ability).

### I need help with my Patreon account...

If you need help with Patreon, please take a look at the [Patreon Help Center](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us) -- as there's tons of detailed posts there addressing the most common requests: login issues, payment issues, how to cancel your account, etc.

If you're stuck with something, start off by [emailing Patreon support directly](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000465611) -- as that's usually the best way to make sure things are resolved. Patreon is a large company with a dedicated support staff -- and they will be back in touch to help solve your problem.

### I need help with printing...

Check out my [printing help page](/printing) for a few common tips.

If you need help with printing a Musicnotes purchase, please visit the [Musicnotes Help Center](https://help.musicnotes.com/hc/en-us) -- they have an extensive library of help pages to assist you. Similar to Patreon, they're a large company with a dedicated support staff who can help you out directly.

### Why are't your song sheets on Patreon anymore?

In May 2021, I moved my "song" PDFs from Patreon to Musicnotes, where they'll be properly licensed and abide by copyright laws. [Please see this page](/copyright) for more details on this topic.
