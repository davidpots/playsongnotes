<p class="large">All of my instructional PDFs are available for download over on my Patreon page. Once you learn how to download them, the process takes just seconds. Here's a quick walkthrough. Make sure you have your Patreon login handy!</p>

<br />
## 1. Open the Patreon Post You're Interested in...

Next, open the Patreon post you're interested in ([here's an example post]((https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/428/))). Make sure you're logged in, and you'll see the full post. Here's what the Patreon post page looks like:

<br /><br />
## 2. Scroll Down & Look for the Attachment Link...

It's at the bottom of the post's body, but _above_ the comment section. It'll appear like a text link, with a small paperclip icon next to it.

<br /><br />
## 3. Click to download, and you're done!

Once you find the link at the bottom of the post, click on it.

Depending on your browser, this will either automatically download it to your operating system _or_ show it full-screen in your browser window (this all depends on your browser and its settings). If clicking the attachment link shows you the PDF full screen, you may to take an extra step to manually save the file (e.g. right click &rarr; "Save as...", etc).

That's it! You're free to print my Patreon PDFs as many times as you want, and of course I recommend you save the file somewhere you'll be able to reference later. But of course, you can re-download things as many times as you want, so long as you're an active member of my Patreon page.

## Quick Tip: Getting to Patreon from PlaySongNotes.com

I've set it up so it's super easy to jump to a specific Patreon post using this current website (**playsongnotes.com**) as a starting point.

First, [search all my lessons](/getting-started/how-to-search-lessons) to find what you're looking for. Then, once you have the lesson page open, look for this button:

<img class="pretty-img" src="https://imagedelivery.net/GppmjzYePBmVFRqlA4p8pQ/3a1efe7c-955c-4ecd-0538-8a051c892900/public" />

Clicking it will link you out to that specific Patreon page. Simply scroll to the bottom of the Patreon post, click the PDF attachment link, and you're done!

Here's a few example posts for you to try yourself. Look for the button on each of these pages:

- [playsongnotes.com/lessons/428/](https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/428/)
- [playsongnotes.com/lessons/302/](https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/370/)

Once you know this process, it only takes seconds.
