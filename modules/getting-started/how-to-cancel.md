<p class="large">I'm unable to cancel for you – Patreon literally doesn't give me that ability – but good news! It's very easy to do yourself... here's how.</p>

<br />
## 1. Log in to Patreon.com

You'll need to be logged in to your Patreon account to cancel. Look for the "Log In" link in the top right of **[patreon.com](http://patreon.com)**. If you're having login issues, [see this help page](/getting-started/how-to-log-in) for solutions to common issues.

<br /><br />
## 2. Visit the "Manage Memberships" page

You can get here directly by navigating to **[patreon.com/pledges](http://patreon.com/pledges)**.

Alternatively, you can get there using the top-right dropdown on the Patreon website. Open the dropdown and click on **Manage Memberships**:

<br /><br />
## 3. Click "Edit" next to "Song Notes by David Pots"

Here, you'll see a list of all your active memberships. Look for my listing ("Song Notes by David Pots") and then click the "Edit" link:

<br /><br />
## 4. Click "Cancel"

When shown the details of your pledge, look for the "Edit or cancel membership" link:

Click that link, and then confirm you want to cancel:

And you're all set!
