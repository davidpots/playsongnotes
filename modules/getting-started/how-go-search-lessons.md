<p class="large">You can easily search all my lessons using this website, playsongnotes.com! No matter which page you're on, look for the search bar at the top of the page.</p>

<br />
## Search using _THIS_ website!

I strongly suggest you use the website you're on now  — **[playsongnotes.com](https://playsongnotes.com/search/?query=+)** – whenever you need to search my lessons.

There's a search bar in the top of the site, accessible from all pages. Simply type your search and hit `RETURN`. You'll see a list of all matching lessons.

## Can you search on Patreon?

You can, but I don't recommend it. I have _hundreds_ of lessons and Patreon's search doesn't do a great job with that much content. If you do want to try searching on Patreon, you can use this address – **[patreon.com/songnotes/posts](https://www.patreon.com/songnotes)**

<br />
## Is there a list of all songs?

There sure is! I made a few pages that let you easily browse all songs, based on a few different criteria:

- **[All songs, sorted alphabetically](/songs/by-title)**
- **[All songs, grouped by artist](/songs/)**
- **[All songs, grouped by year released](/songs/by-year)**

<br />
## Once I find a lesson, how do I get the Patreon PDF?

I've set it up so it's super easy to jump to a specific Patreon post from any lesson page on this website you're reading – **playsongnotes.com**. Simply open up any page on this site, and look out for this button:

Clicking it will link you out to that specific Patreon page. Simply [scroll to the bottom](/getting-started/how-to-download-pdfs) of the Patreon post, click the PDF attachment link, and you're done!


<br />
## Once I find a lesson, how do I get the song sheet?

Similar to getting Patreon PDFs, you simply load the lesson page on **playsongnotes.com** and look for this button:

Clicking it will link you out to that specific page on Musicnotes.com, which is where you can buy my song sheets.


<br />
## Quick Tip #1: Just start typing to begin your search!

On each page of this site, the cursor is automatically ready (i.e. blinking) in the search bar. So, you need only simply start typing whatever you want to find – and then hit `RETURN`. Want to search for something else? Just start typing your new query, and repeat the process. This makes it very easy to use!

<br />
## Quick Tip #2: You can search by lesson number!

You can search by artist, year, genre, etc -- and you can also search by lesson number. This makes it very easy to quickly find a lesson I reference in another video.
