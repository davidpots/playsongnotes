<p class="large">To log in and manage your Song Notes membership, you'll want to head over to <a class="gray-dark" href="https://patreon.com/songnotes">patreon.com/songnotes</a>. There, you'll be able to access members-only content and manage your account. Here's a few helpful tips, with screenshots.</p>

<br />
## Look in the top-right corner of Patreon.com

Patreon is the website where your Song Notes membership is managed. You login by visiting **[patreon.com/login](https://www.patreon.com/login)** or simply looking for the "Log In" link in the top right corner of any Patreon post:

## This website you're reading now doesn't have login feature

Important note: The website you're reading right now – **playsongnotes.com** – does _not_ have a login feature. It's a free directory of all my video lessons, which occasionally "links out" to YouTube, Patreon, Musicnotes, etc.

While I suggest using this site to browse my lessons, just understand that you can't login here.

<br />
## Why does Patreon keep telling me to "Join Now"?

It's because you're viewing my posts on Patreon but aren't logged in.

If you see the "Join Now" prompt, look for the "Log in" link in the top right corner. After you're signed in, the page will show you the members-only content.

Note, if you're on a mobile device and see this message – it may be because an app you clicked on a Patreon link from (e.g. Gmail) is opening a browser _inside_ that app – which is separate from Safari. If this happens, you can either login _or_ look for the Safari icon, which will open that same page in Safari.

<br />
## Why does Patreon not recognize my email address?

You're probably trying to sign in with a different email address than you signed up with.

This is a very common occurrence! And believe me, I know it's hard to keep track of which email address you use sometimes. I suggest trying to sign in again with other emails you may have used in the past. If you still don't have luck, you can email me and I can try looking up your current account based on your first and/or last name (from my list of active patrons).

<br />
## I forgot my Patreon password...

No worries! Patreon has a "reset password" feature in case you forgot. Simply enter your email address on this page: **[patreon.com/forgot-password](https://www.patreon.com/forgot-password)**

...and you'll get an email with a link to set a new password. If it says your email address wasn't found, try using another email address you might have signed up with in the past. Note, I can't reset your password for you.

<br />
## A few quick tips!

- **Try to remember your Patreon password!** I know it's a pain. But it will make your life way easier.

- **Tell your browser to keep you signed in!** Depending on what browser you use (and its settings), I recommend having enabling the option to "keep you logged in" or "save password" (etc). This will prevent you from having to log in every time you visit Patreon.

- **Using an iPhone? Look for the "Open in Safari" icon** Quite often, I'll click a Patreon link from my Gmail app, and it opens up a browser _within Gmail_ that isn't logged in to Patreon. Instead of logging in each time, an easy fix is to click the Safari icon in the toolbar. This will open that same page in Safari (my default browser), which has saved my log in to Patreon.
