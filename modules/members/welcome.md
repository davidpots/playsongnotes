<p class="large">First up, a sincere <em>thank you</em> for supporting my efforts with this project! I'm very excited for you to dive in & enjoy all the fun stuff that's available to you as a Song Notes member.</p>

<br />
## Just signed up? Quick next steps...

First, a few quick suggestions:

- **Check your email** - you'll have received a welcome email from Patreon, with a bunch of handy links -- including the 50% discount code for the current month. Hang on to this email!

- **Bookmark this website** - seriously, you'll want to use playsongnotes.com as the #1 spot to search all my lessons. It's much easier to navigate than Patreon, and it will always "link you out" to any Patreon pages that contain PDFs, etc.

- **Remember your Patreon login info** - this is important! Make sure you keep track of your Patreon email address & password, as you'll need to be logged in to access the members-only PDFs & other content I publish each week.

<br /><br />
## Now, for the fun stuff...

- **You'll get an email every time I post something new** – in your inbox, this will come from "Patreon" – keep an eye out for it! I post 1-2 times a week with new content. The email will include include videos, PDFs, and anything else related to my new lesson.

- **You now have access to all my old Patreon posts** – over 200 posts are now accessible to you, most of which have instructional (non-song) PDFs available for download.

- **You can now save 50% when buying my Musicnotes song sheets** - Patreon supporters get special access to a coupon code which gives you 50% off when buying any of my song sheets at Musicnotes. The code was emailed to you by Patreon immediately after you signed up –– or, you can **[click here](http://playsongnotes.com/discount)** to get the current month's code code.
