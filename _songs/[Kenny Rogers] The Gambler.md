## Chords w/ lyrics

    VERSE
         D                         G               D
    On a warm summer's eve... on a train bound for nowhere
      D                                                    A
    I met up with the gambler... we were both too tired to sleep
       D                                  G             D
    So we took turns a-starin'... out the window at the darkness
        G           D        A                 D      
    The boredom overtook us... and he began to speak

              D                               G                D
    He said, "Son, I've made a life... out of readin' people's faces
    D                                                         A
    Knowin' what the cards were... by the way they held their eyes
          D                                 G                 D
    So if you don't mind me sayin'... I can see you're out of aces
          G             D               A               D
    For a taste of your whiskey... I'll give you some advice"

         D                              G                   D
    So I handed him my bottle... and he drank down my last swallow
    D                                                     A
    ...Then he bummed a cigarette... and asked me for a light
            D                                  G               D
    And the night got deathly quiet... and his face lost all expression
                     G              D                      A                 D
    Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy... you gotta learn to play it right

    CHORUS
                      D                      G               D
        You've got to know when to hold 'em...  know when to fold 'em
        G               D                              A
        ...Know when to walk away...  and know when to run
                  D                               G              D
        You never count your money... when you're sittin' at the table
                    G               D        A                     D
        There'll be time enough for countin'... when the dealing's done

    [ Song modulates up 1/2 step... but I prefer using chords in key of E ]

    E                                  A             E
    ...Every gambler knows... that the secret to survivin'
       E                                                 B7
    Is knowin' what to throw away... and knowin' what to keep
           E                            A               E
    'Cause every hand's a winner... and every hand's a loser
            A                 E                 B7          E
    And the best that you can hope for... is to die in your sleep

        E                               A                      E
    And when he finished speakin'... he turned back toward the window
    E                                                B7
    ...Crushed out his cigarette... and faded off to sleep

    [let chords ring]
        E                                A                 E    
    And somewhere in the darkness... the gambler, he broke even
        A            E                   B7               E
    But in his final words I found... an ace that I could keep

                      E                      A               E
        You've got to know when to hold 'em...  know when to fold 'em
        A               E                              B7
        ...Know when to walk away...  and know when to run
                  E                               A              E
        You never count your money... when you're sittin' at the table
                    A               E        B7                     E
        There'll be time enough for countin'... when the dealing's done
