## Chords needed

## Strumming pattern

Here's the strum pattern I use for this song. On the first down strum I'll emphasize the bassiest string of the chord (or, if not the single bass-most string, the bassiest 2-3 strings).

    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
    D     D        U  D  U

## Lyrics w/ Chords

    G
    Busted flap in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
               G                           D7
    When I was feelin’ near as faded as my jeans
    D7                       
    Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
         D7                         G    C/G  G
    That rode us all the way to New Orleans

      G   
    I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
          G                  G7             C
    I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
    C                                  G
    Windshield wipers flappin' time, I... was holding Bobby’s hand in mine
    D7
    We sang every song that driver knew

    C                               G
    Freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose
        D7                                        G      G7
    And nothing, I mean nothing, hon, if it ain’t free
        C                            G
    And feeling good when was easy, lord, when he sang the blues
             D7                              
    You know feeling good was good enough for me...
       D7                                G
    ...Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

             A
    From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
          A                              E7
    Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
            E7
    Through all kinds of weather to everything we’ve done
         E7                            A
    Yeah Bobby, baby, kept me from the cold

        A
    One day up near Salinas, lord, I let him slip away
         A                A7                 D
    He’s looking for that home and I hope he finds it
            D                              A
    But I’d trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
          E7
    To be holdin’ Bobby’s body next to mine

    D                               A
    Freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose
        E7                                  A    A7
    And nothing, that’s all that Bobby left me
        D                                 A
    And feeling good when was easy, lord, when he sang the blues
        E7   
    And feeling good was good enough for me... hmmm...
       E7                                A
    ...Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
