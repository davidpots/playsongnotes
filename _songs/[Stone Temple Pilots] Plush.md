                .......Will she smell alone?    ==> [ intro riff ]

    VERSE
        And I feel, so much depends on the weather
        So is it raining in your bedroom?
        And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray
        Would you even care?

    PRE-CHORUS
            And I feel it... And she feels it

    CHORUS
                Where you going to tomorrow?
                Where you goin' with the mask I found?
                And I feel, and I feel, when the dogs begin to smell her
                Will she smell alone?

                    ...Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow

                    .........To find it... to find it... to find it

                    [ repeat refrain ]

    OUTRO [w/ intro riff, end on G]
        To find it... to find it... to find it

## Tuning note

STP plays this tuned down one whole step. I keep my guitar in standard tuning in my video lesson. Either tuning works, just keep this in mind re: whoever you're playing along with (their recording, my video lesson, your friends, etc).

## Chords & strumming

Chords for each section are below. If any of the weird bass notes (e.g., D/F# or C/E) give you trouble, you can just use the regular variant of that chord. For the E-flat-major-7, I included two voicings -- personally the pinky stretch version that STP's guitarist uses isn't comfortable for me, so I often choose to use the version on x6878x, simply because I can switch to it faster.

Intro chords:
