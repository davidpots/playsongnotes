## Chords needed

    E –––0––––3––––0––––1––––2––––
    B –––1––––0––––1––––1––––3––––
    G –––0––––0––––2––––2––––2––––
    D –––2––––0––––2––––3––––0––––
    A –––3––––2––––0––––3–––––––––

## Chord progressions

This one is pretty straightforward. There's three main chunks to memorize.

First, the verse. Note that there are a few times in the Sublime version where Bradley slips in an A-minor in place of a G, for some of the chords. This was probably because the song was recorded under what sounds like casual circumstances -- some free play is not to be surprising.

    "Maybe one breath away..."

    C . . . G . . . C . . . G . . .     x2

Second, the start of the chorus (if you can call it that).

    "I don't know if I can..."

    C . . . Am . . . C . . . Am . . .   x1

Third, the turnaround (end of the chorus). Immediately after this, you'll begin the next verse (return to C).

    "Mary baby, please don't fuss and fight"

    F . . . F . . . D . G .

## Lyrics with chords

    C         G           C                G
    Maybe one breath away... I'll find the words to say
    C               G               C              G
    ...I'll sit and light the bong... I'll hold my hit in real long

        C               Am          C       Am            F
        ...I don't know if I can... go up inside of you tonight
           (F)           D            G
        Oh, Mary baby... please don't fuss and fight

    C                   Am
    ...You've heard the line before...
          C                 G
    Mary, baby please don't think I'm a whore
    C              G                       C
    ...If you come home to me turn off the lights...
                                     G
    And lock up the doors, and start getting busy

        C               Am        C            Am           F
        ...I don't know if I can, go so far up inside you tonight
           (F)        D       G
        Oh, Mary baby I could do it right

    C              G           C                   G
    ...When we got to the pad... Mary baby started calling me her dad
    C           Am            C              G
    ...Yes, she gave me head... we could not find a damn bed

        C                Am            C             Am
        ...Fifteen years old plus one, hotter than a microwave oven
        F                D        G           C
        ...Oh Mary baby, daddy is coming home

## Mini verse riff

At the end of the chorus (the final G before you begin the C-Am-C-Am section), you'll often hear something like this. Here's how I play it... watch my video for context.

    E ––––3––––––––––––––––0–––––
    B ––––0––––––––––––––––1–––––
    G ––––0––––––––––––––––0–––––
    D ––––0––––––––––––0–––2–––––
    A ––––2––––––––––2–––––3–––––
    E ––––3––––––––3–––––––––––––
          G                C
