## Capo on 3rd fret

Because playing in the key of Eb is rough on guitar, I prefer to capo the 3rd fret so I can use chords in the key of C.

## Chord progressions

Pretty straightforward here... I'm pretty certain _most_ of these are correct (if anything, some of the the E-minor chords may be E-major, and vice versa)... but this should be enough to get you started.

    INTRO

    PRE CHORUS

    CHORUS

    	Am • • • G • •  • C  • • • E • • •


## Instrumental intro riff

Totally optional of course, but I find it fun to play. Repeat this entire sequence twice -- the second time, changing from an A-minor to a C-major (in the 3rd of the 4 totla chords).

## Lyrics

Here's the first occurrence each of the verse, pre-chorus, and chorus. Obviously, there are additional lyrics -- search around the net to find them.

    I think about that day, I left him at a Greyhound station
    West of Santa Fé... We were seventeen
    But he was sweet and it was true, still I did what I had to do
    'Cause I just knew

    Without a nickel to my name... Hopped a bus, here I came
    Could be brave or just insane... We'll have to see
    'Cause maybe in that sleepy town, he'll sit one day, the lights are down
    He'll see my face and think of how he used to know me

    Climb these hills, I'm reaching for the heights
    And chasing all the lights that shine
    And when they let you down...  You'll get up off the ground
    'Cause morning rolls around... And it's another day of sun

Thanks for reading! Hope this helps.
