## Capo 4th fret

This is so you can use open standard chord shapes, and not be stuck in barre chord hell.

## Chords needed

For the most part, you can use these three chords to play most of the song. Note, the E-minor voicing here is intentionally using only four of the 6 strings. See my video lesson for context here.

    E |–––3––––2––––0–––
    B |–––0––––3––––1–––
    G |–––0––––2––––0–––
    D |–––2––––0––––2–––
    A |–––––––––––––3–––
    E |–––––––––––––––––
          Em   D    C   

You'll also need these chords for other parts of the song:

    E |–––0––––2––––0––––2––––0––––3––––
    B |–––0––––3––––1––––3––––1––––0––––
    G |–––0––––2––––0––––4––––2––––0––––
    D |–––2––––0––––2––––4––––2––––0––––
    A |–––2–––––––––3––––2––––0––––2––––
    E |–––0––––––––––––––––––––––––3––––
          Em   D    C    Bm   Am   G


## Lyrics w/ chords

    VERSE
               Em           D          C                  C  D  Em
            No limit in the sky that I won't fly for you...
                         Em          D           C                  C  D  Em
            No amount of tears in my eyes that I won't cry for you...  

    PRE-CHORUS

            (Em)       D     Em     D      Em
            ......With every breath that I take
              D           C          D           Em
            I want you to share that air with me
            D          Em           D       C
            There's no promise that I won't keep
                         Am                D         Em
            I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep

    CHORUS
                    G        C          Am         D             
            When it comes to you        There’s no crime
                       Bm          Em               Am   C
            Let’s take both of our souls        And intertwine

            (D)     G        C          Am       D
            When it comes to you        Don't be blind
                     Bm            Em             C     D  Em   C     D  Em
            Watch me speak from my heart, When it comes to you, comes to you

    DROP

            Em  D  C ... C  D  Em
            Em  D  C ... C  D  Em

And so forth -- repeat these progressions for each verse / pre-chorus / chorus / drop.
