## Chords w/ lyrics

    INTRO
        C ..... Am ..... C ..... Am .....

    VERSE, pt1
             C                 Am
        I've heard there was a secret chord
             C                    Am
        That David played, and it pleased the Lord
            F                G               C         G
        But you don't really care for music, do you?

    VERSE, pt2
               C                     F           G
            It goes like this... the fourth, the fifth
                Am              F
            The minor fall, the major lift
                G               E           Am
            The baffled king composing Hallelujah

    CHORUS
                     F           Am
                Hallelujah, Hallelujah
                     F           C    G    C    G
                Hallelujah, Hallelu--------jah

        Your faith was strong but you needed proof
        You saw her bathing on the roof
        Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you

            She tied you to her kitchen chair
            She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
            And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

                Hallelujah, Hallelujah
                Hallelujah, Hallelujah

        Baby, I have been here before
        I know this room, I've walked this floor
        I used to live alone before I knew you.

            I've seen your flag on the marble arch
            Love is not a victory march
            It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

                Hallelujah, Hallelujah
                Hallelujah, Hallelujah

        There was a time when you let me know
        What's really going on below
        But now you never show it to me, do you?

            And remember when I moved in you
            The holy dove was moving too
            And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

                Hallelujah, Hallelujah
                Hallelujah, Hallelujah

        Maybe there's a God above
        But all I've ever learned from love
        Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you

            It's not a cry you can hear at night
            It's not somebody who has seen the light
            It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

                Hallelujah, Hallelujah
                Hallelujah, Hallelujah

        You say I took the name in vain
        I don't even know the name
        But if I did, well, really... what's it to you?

            There's a blaze of light in every word
            It doesn't matter which you heard
            The holy or the broken Hallelujah

                Hallelujah, Hallelujah
                Hallelujah, Hallelujah

        I did my best, it wasn't much
        I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
        I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you

            And even though it all went wrong
            I'll stand before the Lord of Song
            With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

                Hallelujah, Hallelujah
                Hallelujah, Hallelujah

                (repeat chorus as desired, end)

## Notes and tabs

### Standard Tuning, No Capo
Let me note that I'm approaching this song in the key of C, to match the tone of the Leonard Cohen original, as well as the Rufus Wainwright cover. Other lessons out there instruct you to play this in the key of G with a capo. I won't be doing that, sorry!

### Guitar Chords Used
Here is how to play the guitar chords used in this song.

    e-|---0----0----1----3----0----
    B-|---1----1----1----0----0----
    G-|---0----2----2----0----1----
    D-|---2----2----3----0----2----
    A-|---3----0----3----2----2----
    E-|-------------1----3----0----
          C    Am   F    G    E

### Optional Intro Tab
Here is an approximate tab of how I like to play the intro on solo acoustic guitar. This focuses on the notes I play between the C and Am chords -- I'm assuming you'll fill in the rhythmic gaps with whatever strumming / picking pattern you prefer.

    e-|-----0---------0---------0--------------0----
    B-|-----1---------1---------1--------------1----
    G-|-----0---------2---------0--------------2----
    D-|-----2---------2---------2------0--2----2----  ...with desired strum pattern
    A-|---3------2--0------2--3--------------0------
    E-|---------------------------------------------
          C         Am        C              Am

### End of Chorus Turnaround
Here is a fun little riff to transition from the G to C chords at the end of each chorus. This is optional as well. At the simplest, you can do this simple bass run up to the G chord:

    e-|----0------------3---
    B-|----1------------0---
    G-|----0------------0---
    D-|----2------------0---
    A-|----3------------2---
    E-|---------0--1--3-----
           C          G

And if you want to take it further, I like adding this little riff with my pinky to the C and G chords that come before the tab shown directly above.

    e-|------------------------------------------
    B-|---1---------------------1----------------
    G-|---0----------0----------0------------0---
    D-|---2--3--2----0----------2------------0---
    A-|---3----------2--3--2----3------------2---
    E-|--------------3---------------0--1--3-----
          C          G          C          G

### On the Order of the Verses
One last note: I admit I am not an expert or a scholar on what the canonical number of (or, order of) verses in this song. Cohen's studio version has different verses from many of the covers, and sometimes the order of verses is different. Above, I've included all the verses I've heard before in the order I prefer -- and I'll let you do with them what you will.
