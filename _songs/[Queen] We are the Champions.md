## Lyrics with chords

    (capo 3rd fret)

                 Am    Em               Am    Em
    I've paid my dues....... time after time
                 Am        Em                    Am     Em
    I've done my sentence...... but committed no crime

               C      F                  C     F
    And bad mistakes........ I've made a few
                C             G/B          Am
    I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
        D         G
    But I've come through... (and I need just go!)
    G4       G   G4      G   G4           A
    On...... and on..... and on...... and on

        D          F#m           Bm       G  A
        We are the champions, my friends
            D             F#m               G    B7
        And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end

        Em                      Gm         A6    A
        We are the champions... we are the champions

        D           C              F          G         G6/A
        No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions
                      Dm  G/D  Dm  G/D  Dm  G6/A
        ......of the world

    [ use same chords for 2nd verse & chorus ]

    I've taken my bows... and my curtain calls
    You brought me fame & fortune & everything that goes w/ it
    I thank you all
    But it's been no bed of roses... no pleasure cruise
    I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
    And I ain't gonna lose... (and I need just go!)
    On... and on... and on... and on

        We are the champions, my friends
        And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
        We are the champions... we are the champions
        No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions
        ......of the world

        (repeat chorus as desired)

## Chords needed

Here's the chords I use in this lesson. Quite a lot!

## Strumming

For starters, understand we have 6 counts per measure. The "1" and "4" counts should get the accent. The simplest way to strum is to do a downstrum on these two beats:

    D = down strum
    U = up strum

    1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 +
    D           D

From there, add smaller / weaker down strums on the "2" and "3" counts, keeping the accent (emphasis) on the "1".

    1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 +
    D   d   d   D   d   d

Then, if you desire, you can add upstrums in between the smaller down strums:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 +
    D   d u d u D   d u d u
