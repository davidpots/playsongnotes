## Lyrics with chords

    INTRO
        C  Am    x4

    VERSE
                C
        They're there for your first year, they give you your first beer
             Dm
        When you get your heart broke, they're there for your worst year
              G (w/ riff)                                       C         Am  C  Am
        Don't get you at all, but your apple don't fall too far from 'em

             C
        They own too much wicker and drink too much liquor
              Dm
        You'd wash your hands of them, but blood's always thicker
            G (w/ riff)
        You might look just like 'em, that don't mean you're like 'em
                C
        But you love 'em

    CHORUS
        C                    F
        Family is family, in church or in prison
            G                         F            G
        You get what you get, and you don't get to pick 'em
             C                              F
        They might smoke like chimneys, but give you their kidneys
              G                          F         G        C Am C Am
        Yeah, friends come in handy, but family is family

    VERSE #2
                C
        They're there when you're married, divorced, and remarried
            Dm
        You fall out of touch, but then someone gets buried
                   G (w/ riff)                                    C  Am C Am
        And you're right back together like no time has ever gone by

                   C
        Can't live with or without 'em, you might talk about 'em
               Dm
        But if someone else does well, then you'll knock 'em out cause
             G (w/ riff)                                            C
        When it's all said and done, they're the only ones that you got

    CHORUS #2
            [chorus]  =>  C Dm F G

    CHORUS #3
                 C                        F
            Yeah family is funny, they'll ask you for money
            G                         F            G
            Even though they know you ain't got no money
                 C                         F
            They show up at Christmas, get up in your business
                 G                       F         G       =>   C  Am  x4
            They might not be fancy, but family is family

    ENDING
            G (w/ riff)
        You might look just like 'em, that don't mean you're like 'em
                 C (let ring)
        But you love 'em
