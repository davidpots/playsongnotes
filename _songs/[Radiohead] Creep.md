## Lyrics w/ chords

    INTRO
    G - B - C - Cm

    VERSE
                         G                                 B
    When you were here before...I couldn’t look you in the eye
                  C                             Cm
    Just like an angel... your skin makes me cry
                     G                         B
    You float like a feather... in a beautiful world
                   C                         Cm
    And I wish was special... you’re so very special

    CHORUS
                  C              B
        But I’m a creep... I’m a weirdo
                                 C                 Cm
        What the hell am I doing here... I don’t belong here

        (repeat same progression for rest of song)

    I don’t care if it hurts... I wanna have control
    I want a perfect body... I want a perfect soul
     I want you to notice... when I’m not around
    You’re so very special... I wish I was special

        But I’m a creep... I’m a weirdo
        What the hell am I doing here?
        When I don’t belong here...

        Whoa, whoa...
        She’s... running out the door...
        She’s... running out, she run, run...
        Run... Run...

    Whatever makes you happy... whatever you want
     You’re so very special... I wish I was special

        But I’m a creep... I’m a weirdo
        What the hell am I doing here?
        I don’t belong here... I don’t belong here

                                        (end on G)

## Chords

I prefer starting with a 3-finger position for each chord:

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––––––––––––––––4–––––
    G –––4––––8––––9––––5–––––
    D –––5––––9–––10––––x–––––
    A –––x––––x––––x––––3–––––
    E –––3––––7––––8––––––––––
         G    B    C    Cm    

As I show in the video lesson, this finger approach lets you add the 4th tone to each chord, to match the vibe that the lead guitarist adds during Radiohead's version of this song. See my video lesson for reference:

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––––––––––––––––6–––––
    G –––5––––9–––10––––5–––––
    D –––5––––9–––10––––x–––––
    A –––x––––x––––x––––3–––––
    E –––3––––7––––8––––––––––
         G4   B4   C4   Cm4    

Or you can play the chords like this:

    4-finger version:                Fully barred version:

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––       E –––3––––7––––8––––3–––––
    B ––––––––––––––––––4–––––       B –––3––––7––––8––––4–––––
    G –––4––––8––––9––––5–––––       G –––4––––8––––9––––5–––––
    D –––5––––9–––10––––5–––––       D –––5––––9–––10––––5–––––
    A –––5––––9–––10––––3–––––       A –––5––––9–––10––––3–––––
    E –––3––––7––––8––––x–––––       E –––3––––7––––8––––x–––––
         G    B    C    Cm                G    B    C    Cm
