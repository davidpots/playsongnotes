    INTRO

        C  /  Am  /  Dm  /  G  /

    CHORUS
              C
              Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
                      Am
              But the very next day you gave it away
              Dm
              This year, to save me from tears
                   G
              I'll give it to someone special

              [chorus x1] => [instrumental chorus x1]

    VERSE
        C
        ...Once bitten and twice shy
        Am
        ...I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
        Dm
        ...Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
        G       
        ...Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

        C
        ...(Merry Christmas!) I wrapped it up and sent it
        Am
        With a note saying, "I love you, " I meant it
        Dm
        Now, I know what a fool I've been
                  G
        But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

              [chorus x2] => [instrumental chorus x1]

        C
        ...A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
        Am
        ...I'm hiding from you, and your soul of ice
        Dm
        ...My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
        G
        Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

          C
        A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
          Am
        A man under cover but you tore me apart
        Dm
        .........Ooohhh....
                  G
        Now, I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

              [chorus x2]

          C
        A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
          Am
        A man under cover but you tore him apart
        Dm
        ...Maybe... next year...
             G                                              
        I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone...
        C        Am    Dm    G    (repeat progression, fade out to end)
        Special...
