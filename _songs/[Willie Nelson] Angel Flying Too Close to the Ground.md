## Lyrics w/ chords

    VERSE 1 (INTRO):
        A                      C#m     D                  A
        ...If you had not have fallen... I would not have found you
        D               E                A           E
        ...Angel flying too close to the ground

    VERSE 2:
        A                        C#m          D                    A   (walk up)
        ...And I patched up your broken wing.... and hung around a while
        B7                                 E                      (walk up)
        ...Trying to keep your spirits up.... and your fever down

    VERSE 3:
        A                  C#m                     D  (walk down)
        ...I knew someday------ that you would fly away
        B7                                      E    (walk up)
        ...For love's the greatest healer to be found

    VERSE 4:
        A                     C#m      D                 D#°
        ...So leave me if you need to.... I will still remember
        A               E                A        E
        ...Angel flying too close to the ground

Stay tuned for the complete lyrics w/ chords for the entire song.

For a hint, the solo uses the chords from verse 1 & verse 2, and the final few choruses use the chords from verse 3 & verse 4 (and finally, repeat the verse 4 chords on additional time for the final chorus).

## Good luck!
