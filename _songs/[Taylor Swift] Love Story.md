## How to play the chords

Here is the simplest way to play the chords used throughout this song. Note, the final chorus goes up one full step to the key of E -- which makes all of these chords change. Technically you could get away without making this change (as the new chords aren't as simple to play), but they're shown below as well.

    e-|---2-----2-----3-----0-----          e-|----0----2-----4-----0-----
    B-|---3-----3-----3-----2-----          B-|----0----4-----5-----2-----
    G-|---2-----4-----0-----2-----          G-|----1----4-----6-----2-----
    D-|---0-----4-----0-----2-----          D-|----2----4-----6-----2-----
    A-|---------2-----2-----0-----          A-|----2----2-----4-----0-----
    E-|---------------3-----------          E-|----0----------------------
          D     Bm    G     A                      E    B    C#m    A

## Picking pattern for the intro & verse riff

If you want to sound like the album version of this song, these are the versions of the chords you'll use for the intro and verse riff. The main thing to note is that the high E string is left open the whole time, so that it can be heard and remains constant as the chords change. The exact picking pattern is shown below.

    e-|---0-----0-----0-----0-----
    B-|---3-----3-----3-----3-----
    G-|---2-----4-----0-----2-----
    D-|---0-----4-----0-----2-----
    A-|---------2-----2-----0-----
    E-|---------------3-----------
          D     Bm    G     A

Here is how you pick the riff that is heard in the song's intro and during the verses. When you're learning this, practice putting your left hand into the chord position that each pattern uses. This will help you realize that patterns like this are typically nothing more than picking strings that are within set chords.

    e-|------0---0--------|------0---0--------|------0---0--------|------0---0--------
    B-|--------3---3---3--|--------3---3---3--|--------3---3---3--|--------3---3---3--

## Lyrics w/ chords

    INTRO
        D ... Bm ... G ... A ... (see riff below)

    VERSE
        D
        We were both young when I first saw you
          Bm
        I close my eyes and the flashback starts
                     G                         A
        I'm standing there... in a balcony and summer air

        See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
        See you make your way through the crowd
        And say hello... little did I know

    PRE-CHORUS
                 G                        A
            That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
                   Bm                          D
            And my Daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
                      G
            And I was crying on the staircase
            A                        Bm    A        G
            Begging you please don't go....... and I said

    CHORUS
              D
              Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
              A
              I'll be waiting, all we've got to do is run
              Bm
              You be the prince and I'll be the princess
              G                  A (let ring)           D
              It's a love story, baby just say... "yes"

        So, I sneak out to the garden to see you
        Keeping quiet, 'cause we're dead if he knew
        So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while

          Oh, 'cause you were Romeo, I was the scarlet letter
          And my Daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
          And you were everything to me
          I was begging you please don't go... and I said

              Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
              I'll be waiting, all we've got to do is run
              You be the prince and I'll be the princess
              It's a love story, baby just say "yes"

              Romeo, save me... they're trying to tell me how to feel
              This love is difficult, but it's so real
              Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
              It's a love story, baby just say "yes"

              (instrumental chorus x1)

    BRIDGE
                                 Bm       G
                  I got tired of waiting...
                               D                        A
                  Wondering if you were ever coming around
                  My faith in you was fading
                  When I met you on the outskirts of town... and I said

              Romeo, save me... I've been feeling so alone
              I keep waiting for you but you never come
              Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
              He knelt to the ground, and pulled a ring and said

    FINALE          
                   E
                  "Marry me, Juliet You never have to be alone
                  B
                  I love you, and that's all I really know
                  C#m
                  I talked to your Dad, go pick out a white dress
                  A                  B
                  It's a love story, baby just say..."

                  E          B         C#m
                  Yes... Oh, oh... Oh, oh...
                         A                                   E (let ring)
                  'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
