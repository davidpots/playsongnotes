## Lyrics w/ chords

    INTRO
        Dadd5 (repeat) => D-riff G6 A (repeat)

    VERSE
        D                  G6           A          D    (riff) G6 A
        ...I listen to the wind, to the wind of my soul
        D                            G6              A             D  (riff)  G6 A
        ...Where I'll end up, well I think... only God really knows

    CHORUS
            G       A            G   A   D
            ...I've sat upon the setting sun
            Em     G          Em        G        A
            ...But never, nev---er, nev---er, never
            G    A            G  A  D
            ...I never wanted water once
            Em     G         A       D  (riff) G6 A
            ...No, never nev--er, never

    VERSE
        D                  G6             A           D   (riff) G6 A
        ...I listen to my words, but they fall far below
        D                 G6               A          D      (riff) G6 A
        ...I let my music take me where my heart wants to go

    CHORUS
            G    A             G  A    D
            ...I swam upon the devil's lake
            Em     G          Em        G        A
            ...But never, nev---er, nev---er, never
            G       A              G    A   D
            ...I'll never make the same mistake
            Em     G         A       D  (riff) G6 A
            ...No, never nev--er, never

            [repeat main D-G-A riff a few times, end on D]
