    VERSE
        G
        Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
        C                                      G
        Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
        C
        It takes a lot to change a man
                 G       D/F#     Em
        Hell, it takes a lot to try
        D                          C          G
        Maybe it's time to let the old ways die

        G
        Nobody knows what waits for the dead
        C                                    G
        Nobody knows what waits for the dead
        C
        Some folks just believe in the things they've
        G             D/F#           Em
        Heard and the things they've read
        D                 C               G
        Nobody knows what waits for the dead

    CHORUS
                C                               G
            I'm glad I can't go back to where I came from
                C                                  G
            I'm glad those days are gone, gone for good
                C
            But if I could take spirits from my
            G        D/F#          Em             D                C
            Past and bring 'em here... you know I would... know I would

        G
        Nobody speaks to God these days
        C                              G
        Nobody speaks to God these days
            C
        I'd like to think he's lookin' down
        G        D/F#       Em
        Laughin' at our ways
        D                 C          G
        Nobody speaks to God these days

            C                                   G
            When I was a child, they tried to fool me
                     C                                        G
            Said the worldly man was lost and that a hell was real
                C
            But I've seen hell in Reno
                G            D/F#     Em               D               C
            And this world's----- one big old Catherine wheel, spinning steel

        G
        Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
        C                                      G
        Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
        C
        It takes a lot to change a man
              G           D/F#       Em
        And a train to change your mind
        D                          C          G
        Maybe it's time to let the old ways die

            D                          C          G    (end on G)
        Oh, maybe it's time to let the old ways die

## Chords needed

You only need three chords for this song (G, C, and D). Here's a few ways to play them:

    E –––3––––0––––2––––         E –––3––––3––––2––––
    B –––0––––1––––3––––         B –––3––––3––––3––––
    G –––0––––0––––2––––         G –––0––––0––––2––––
    D –––0––––2––––0––––   or    D –––0––––2––––0––––
    A –––2––––3–––––––––         A –––2––––3–––––––––
    E –––3––––––––––––––         E –––3––––––––––––––
         G    C    D                  G    C    D    

## Walking down from G to Em

In both the verse and the chorus, there's a distinctive walk-down that can be heard (from G to D/F# to E-minor). Here's two different ways to play it. When I do a D/F#, I either focus on the bottom four strings (2002xx) -- or I'll just keep the G shape with my pinky, but add the F# bass note (2nd fret of the low E string). They both sound good, in my opinion.

    E ––––––3––––––––––-––––––0––––         E ––––––3––––––––3–-––––––0––––         
    B ––––––0––––––––––-––––––0––––         B ––––––0––––––––0–-––––––0––––         
    G ––––––0––––––––2–-––––––0––––         G ––––––0––––––––0–-––––––0––––         
    D ––––––0––––––––0–-––––––2––––   or    D ––––––0––––––––0–-––––––2––––         
    A ––––––2––––––––0–-––––––2––––         A ––––––2––––––––x–-––––––2––––         
    E –––3––3–––––2––2–––––0––0––––         E –––3––3–––––2––2–––––0––0––––         
            G     D/F#       Em                     G     G/F#       Em             

## Chord progression cheat sheet:

Here's a bird's eye view of the chord progressions used in this song (i.e., for the verse and chorus). They're very similar, the only differences being which chords you start & end with - for the most part. Remember, four counts per measure.

    Verse:        "Maybe it's time to let the old ways die..."

                  | G          | G          | G          | G         |
                  | C          | C          | G          | C         |
                  | C          | C          | G    D/F#  | Em        |
                  | D          | C          | G          | G         |


    Chorus:       "I'm glad I can't go back to where I came from..."

                  | C          | C          | G          | G         |
                  | C          | C          | G          | G         |
                  | C          | C          | G    D/F#  | Em        |
                  | D          | D          | C          | C         |

## Strumming pattern

The main idea with the strumming pattern, no matter which one you choose to employ, is to try to accent the 2 and the 4 counts. Even if you do simple down-strums on all 4 counts, try to give a little oomph to the 2 and the 4 (or alternatively, ease up on the 1 and the 3).

    Simple strum:     1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
                      D   D   D   D
                          >       >

    Full strum #1:    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
                      D   D   D U D U
                          >       >

    Full strum #2:    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
                      D   D U   U D U
                          >       >

## Good luck!

I hope this helps, and as always let me know if you have any questions.
