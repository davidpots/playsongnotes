## Chords needed

The entire song uses these four chords, in this order, over and over. Very straight forward. For the G, you can play the 3rd fret on the B string if you want - that's a correct way to play G also.

    E ––––3–––––0–––––0–––––2–––––
    B ––––0–––––0–––––1–––––3–––––
    G ––––0–––––0–––––0–––––2–––––
    D ––––0–––––2–––––2–––––0–––––
    A ––––2–––––2–––––3–––––––––––
    E ––––3–––––0–––––––––––––––––
          G     Em    C     D

As I note in my video lesson, if you're having trouble with the chord transitions, realize that for some of the transitions you're keeping fingers on the same note. This makes changing much easier, since it is one less finger to move. For example:

    E ––––3–––––0––––
    B ––––0–––––0––––
    G ––––0–––––0––––
    D ––––0–––––2––––
    A ––––2–––––2––––   <-- index finger plays 2nd fret for both chords
    E ––––3–––––0––––
          G     Em   

And also for the Em to the C:

    E ––––0–––––0––––
    B ––––0–––––1––––
    G ––––0–––––0––––
    D ––––2–––––2––––   <-- middle finger plays the 2nd fret for both chords
    A ––––2–––––3––––
    E ––––0––––––––––
          Em    C    

And finally, for the D to G turnaround:

    E ––––2––––––3––––
    B ––––3––––––3––––  <-- ring finger plays the 3rd fret for both chords
    G ––––2––––––0––––
    D ––––0––––––0––––
    A –––––––––––2––––
    E –––––––––––3––––
          D      G

In general, keep an eye out for this sort of "pivot note" transition in any song you're learning. It can make many chord transitions much easier, and faster, to pull off while keeping in step with the song's rhythm.

## Chord progression and timing

Quite simply, you'll be doing one measure (four counts) of each chord, in sequence. That is:

    1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  
    G  .  .  .  Em .  .  .  C  .  .  .  D  .  .  .

I recommend counting out loud, if you can, to master the timing (if it's giving you trouble).

## Strumming pattern

I recommend this strumming pattern for the whole song:

    D = down strum
    U = up strum

    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
    D     D  U     U  D  U

Repeat this, playing the pattern once per each chord. If it's giving you trouble, simplify it and start with something you can do without much challenge. Such as

    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
    D     D     D     D

From there, add an up-strum on the final "4 +" count:

    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
    D     D     D     D  U

Then, once you have that, don't strum on the "3" count:

    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
    D     D           D  U

And finally, one you have mastered that, add up strums on the "2 +" and "3 +" counts.

    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
    D     D  U     U  D  U

The key is to keep your strumming hand (arm) moving up and down continuously, but only bringing the pick down on the strings when the strumming pattern demands it.

## Lyrics w/ chords

       G                     Em
    Oh where, oh where can my baby be
    C                     D
    ...The lord took her away from me
    G                               Em
    ...She’s gone to heaven so I’ve got to be good
       C                        D
    So I can see my baby when I leave this world

        (use G-Em-C-D for the entire song!)

    We were out on a date in my daddy’s car
    We hadn’t driven very far
    There in the road straight ahead
    A car was stalled, the engines dead
     I couldn’t stop so I swerved to the right
    I’ll never forget the sound that night
    The screamin’ tires, the bustin’ glass
    The painful scream that I heard last

        (stay on G for 2 measures on "last")

    Oh where, oh where can my baby be
    The Lord took her away from me
    She’s gone to heaven so I’ve got to be good
    So I can see my baby when I leave this world

    When I woke up the rain was pourin’ down
    There were people standing all around
    Something warm flowing through my eyes
    But somehow I found my baby that night
     I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
    Hold me darling, just a little while
    I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
    I found the love that I knew I would miss

    Well, now she’s gone, even though I hold her tight
    I lost my love, my life that night

    Oh where, oh where can my baby be
    The Lord took her away from me
    She’s gone to heaven so I’ve got to be good
    So I can see my baby when I leave this world

    Oooooh...
    Oooh, ooooh...
    Oooooh...
    Oooh, ooooh...

    Ooohhhhhh, oooooh...
    Oooooooohhhhhh...
    Ooohhhhhh, oooooh...
    Ahhh...

## Good luck!

I hope this helps, and as always let me know if you have any questions.
