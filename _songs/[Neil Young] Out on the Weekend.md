## Chords w/ lyrics

    INTRO
        Bm  ... E  ... Bm ... E ...
        Bm  ... E  ... Bm ... E ...    
        C#m ... F# ... Bm ... E ...

    VERSE
       A                          Bm
        Think I'll pack it in and... buy a pickup
       E                    A
        Take it down to L.A.
       A                          Bm
        Find a place to call my own... and try to fix up
       E                    A     A2
        Start a brand new day

       A                                Bm
        The woman I'm thinking of, she... loved me all up
       E                     A
        But I'm so down today
       A                                Bm                   E  E7
        She's so fine, she's in my mind... I hear her calling

    CHORUS    
           A                  Bm
            See the lonely boy... out on the weekend
           E                  A
            Trying to make it pay
           A                    Bm
            Can't relate to joy... he tries to speak and
           E               A
            Can't begin to say

    BREAK
                Bm  ... E  ... Bm ... E ...
                C#m ... F# ... Bm ... E ...

        She got pictures on the wall... they make me look up
        From her big brass bed
        Now I'm running down the road... trying to stay up
        Somewhere in her head

        The woman I'm thinking of... she loved me all up
        But I'm so down today
        She's so fine, she's in my mind... I hear her calling

            See the lonely boy... out on the weekend
            Trying to make it pay
            Can't relate to joy... he tries to speak and
            Can't begin to say

    OUTRO
                Bm  ... E  ... Bm ... E ...
                C#m ... F# ... Bm ... E ...
                A   ... Bm ... E  ... A ... (fade to end)
