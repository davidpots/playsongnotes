## One 4-chord progression for the entire song!

This entire song uses a single 4-chord progression, repeating over and over. This makes things super simple to memorize, since you don't need to remember something different for the verse vs. chorus vs. intro, etc. A choice you'll have to make is whether or not you use a capo. If you don't use a capo, you'll need to play one barre chord (B minor). You could use a capo on the 2nd or 7th fret -- the latter allowing you to play the progression using no capo. This can be handy if you don't know barre chords yet.

Chord progression used if you use *no capo*:

    Bm . . . G . . . D . . . A . . .

Chord progression used if you use *capo on 2nd fret*:

    Am . . . F . . . C . . . G . . .

Chord progression used if you use *capo on 7th fret*:

    Em . . . C . . . G . . . D . . .

## Intro tab?

To be honest, this isn't something I've been able to learn -- it certainly requires a level of skill that's in the intermediate/advanced range when it comes to fret pull-offs. To be honest, this isn't something I'm too great at! Best of luck working it out though -- check YouTube, because there are definitely some good tutorials out there.

## Good luck!

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.
