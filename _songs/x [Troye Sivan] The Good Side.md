## Capo 2nd fret

I recommend playing this with capo 2nd fret, which is how Troye Sivan (or his guitarist) plays it. It allows you to capture the same "high E string left open" sound that is characteristic of this song. That said, I also show a no capo version in my video above.

## Chord progression for the entire song

Quite simply, with capo on the 2nd fret, this progression is repeated for the whole song!

    C   Em   F   G

Without a capo, these are:

    D  F#m   G   A

## Chords tabs w/ capo 2

Here's how it's played on the album - you can also see the guitarist using these chords during Sivan's SNL performance from January 2018. The main thing to note here is the high E string is left open for all the chords. Also note how the G chord is a slid-up version of the F chord (i.e., slide up 2 frets using the same chord shape). For the F and the G, I wrap my thumb around to play the low E string for each chord. This isn't required, but is nice if you can pull it off.

    E –––0––––0–––––0––––0–––
    B –––1––––0–––––1––––3–––
    G –––0––––0–––––2––––4–––
    D –––2––––2–––––3––––5–––
    A –––3––––2–––––3––––5–––
    E ––––––––0––––(1)––(3)––
         C    Em    F    G

If you have trouble with the F and G voicings above, try these variants:

    E –––0––––0–––––0––––0–––
    B –––1––––0–––––1––––3–––
    G –––0––––0–––––2––––4–––
    D –––2––––2–––––3––––5–––
    A –––3––––2––––––––––––––
    E ––––––––0––––––––––––––
         C    Em    F    G

## Chords with no capo

If you want to play it without a capo, use the chords below – and note how the 2nd fret of the high E-string is used in all chords. Again, this matches the droning note you hear played on the album. Technically, the G is a Gmaj7, and the A is an Aadd6.

    E –––2––––2–––––2––––2––––
    B –––3––––2–––––0––––2––––
    G –––2––––2–––––0––––2––––
    D –––0––––4–––––0––––2––––
    A ––––––––4–––––x––––0––––
    E ––––––––2–––––3–––––––––
         D   F#m    G    A

## Strumming pattern

I prefer a "DOWN down-up-down-up" that repeats 4 times for each chord. Then, switch to the next chord and repeat it again 4 times. You'll want to accent the first down strum of each sequence. Here's how I'd write it out:

    1 + 2 + 3 +   1 + 2 + 3 +   1 + 2 + 3 +   1 + 2 + 3 +
    D   d u d u   D   d u d u   D   d u d u   D   d u d u
    >             >             >             >

If you have trouble, I recommend starting with playing only the first down strum of each 3-count sequence:

    1 + 2 + 3 +   1 + 2 + 3 +   1 + 2 + 3 +   1 + 2 + 3 +   
    D             D             D             D             

And from there, if you want, you could also just do a "up down up" to end each 3-count sequence. Which would look like this:

    1 + 2 + 3 +   1 + 2 + 3 +   1 + 2 + 3 +   1 + 2 + 3 +
    D     u d u   D     u d u   D     u d u   D     u d u
    >             >             >             >

## Lyrics w/ chords

    (capo 2nd fret)

    INTRO
        C    Em    F    G

    VERSE
        C
        I got the good side of things
        Em
        Left you with both of the rings
        F
        My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
            G
        The change in the wind took you down to your knees

        C
        I got the good side of you
        Em
        Sent it out into the blue
        F   
        The people danced to the sound of your heart
            G
        The world sang along to it falling apart

    CHORUS
                   C                   Em
            But I... sympathize, and I.... recognize
                         F                          G                           C
            And baby, I apologize... that I got the good side, the good side of things

                [ solo riff, with C-E-F-G progression ]

        I got the good side of life
        Travelled the universe twice
        So many thoughts I wanted to share
        But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair

        Then I got the good side of new
        Found arms to fall right into
        I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
        And some day I hope that you'll understand

            That I sympathize, and I recognize
            And baby, I apologize
            That I got the good side
            The good side of things

        I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
        And catch up on everything
        I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
        You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

            But I sympathize, and I recognize
            And baby, I apologize
            That I got the good side
            The good side of things

            Sympathize, recognize
            Apologize
            That I got the good side
            The good side of things

## Good luck!

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.
