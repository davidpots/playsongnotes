## Lyrics w/ chords

    * Capo 1st fret

    VERSE, PART 1
                  E
        He drinks orange juice and vodka, in the basement while she's talking
            E                                            B7
        To someone long distance, for hours and hours on end
            B7
        And as he's slowly sippin', he thinks about his children
                B7                                                   E
        And the heart attacks that youngest daughter's always giving him

    VERSE, PART 2
                       E
            He ain't smoked no marijuana, since he got on with the railroad
                      E                                                   A
            And he's been on with the railroad, for a long and lonesome while
                     A                           E
            But the day that he retires, he'll smoke himself to China
                  B7                                                   E
            He'll leave behind his worries, as he's racing through the sky

    CHORUS
                             A                    E                 B7                 E
                The days are dark... down in the holler... Waitin' for... the sun to shine
                        A                       E                   B7               E
                On the back... you have been breakin'... tryin' to earn... peace of mind

                  E
        She sells Avon to her buddies... and saves a little money
                E                                           B7
        On the makeup she's been using... to hide away the years
                B7
        And she sits and watches TV... usually every evening
                 B7                                                        E
        If there ain't some kind of ballgame... that her daughter has to cheer

                        E
            She sneaks menthols in the mornin'... while her family's still snorin'
                E                                                 A
            And as she burns the Eggo's... she looks back at her life
                 A                                       E
            That heart she broke in high school... he's singing on the Opry
                 B7                                                   E
            She wonders what the hell... that she was thinkin' at the time

                [ CHORUS ]

        Their [E] youngest daughter Stella... she's running with this fell
        That [E] he cannot stand the thought of... that he surely does de[B7]spise
        He's [B7] told her he best never... see the two of them together
        But it's [B7] hard to keep an eye on her... when you're workin' all the [E] time

            There are [E] things he needs to tend to... and the bills the bank keeps sendin'
            Lord, the [E] zeros on the end keep pushing further to the [A] right
            Like a [A] freight train haulin' sorrow... and [A] movin' ever onward
            Through the [B7] tunnel of forever... to the never endin' [E] light
