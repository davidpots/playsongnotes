## Chord progressions

Intro & filler riff:

    E   /   /   /     ...played w/ bass-line riff

Verse:

    "We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files..."

    E   /   /   E7   /   A   /   A7  /
    D   G   C   Am   /   E   /   D7  /  

Chorus:

    "And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson..."

    G   Em  G   Em   C   /   D   /
    G   Em  G   Em   C   /   Am  /   -->  intro w/ riff

## Strumming pattern

There's some flexibility with how you strum, though I think the most important thing is to accent the 2nd (and possibly 4th) beat of every four-beat measure. You might start with practicing down-strums only, on the 2nd and 4th beats:

            ↓               ↓      
    1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +  

Once you have that, you can add to it by adding some additional strums (played not quite as loud) on these other beats. Again, make sure the 2nd and 4th beats are where most of your accent is.

            >               >      
    ↓       ↓   ↑       ↑   ↓   ↑  
    1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +

        Joltin' Joe has left and gone away... hey hey hey
                E
        Hey hey hey...

## Intro and fill riff

Repeat this as desired (usually two or four times is what I do). If you prefer, you can strum the E-chord for the full duration of this 8-count section, while accenting the bass-line melody notes. Or you can play a straight E chord and ignore the melody notes – it's up to you.

    E –––0–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –––0–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    G –––1–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    D –––2––––––––––––––0–––––2––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    A –––2–––––0––2––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    E –––0–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
         1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  5  +  6  +  7  +  8  +

## Other riffs and fills

### Verse melody

If you want to emulate the vocal melody with your guitar while staying in the open E and open A positions, focus on these notes. You can strum along if you're able to do so (though that's a bit trickier).
