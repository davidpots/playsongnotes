## Chords needed

The entire song uses these 4 chords, in this order, repeating. The pinky on the high E-string (for all chords) isn't required for the C and Am, but it helps keep the sound consistent. Play whatever version of F you prefer – I like this one (or a 3-string version on the D/G/B strings) because they work well with the flourish-note riff I show below.

    E ––––3––––3––––3––––3––––
    B ––––1––––1––––1––––0––––
    G ––––2––––0––––2––––0––––
    D ––––3––––2––––2––––0––––
    A –––––––––3––––0––––2––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––3––––
          F    C    Am   G    

## Strumming and timing

An easy way to play this is using all down-strums. As such, divide up each chord as follows – and accent the first strum of each chord.

    F        C              Am       G
    •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  
    >        >              >        >

The same diagram but with counting instead of generic dots (for each eighth note), is as follows:

    F        C              Am       G
    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
    >        >              >        >

## Adding flourish note to your strumming

While doing your regular strumming, try to add/remove the notes shown below. See my video for reference.

    E ––––3––––––––3––––––––––––––3––––––––3–––––––––––––––
    B ––––1––––––––1––––––––––––––1––0––1––0–––––1––0––––––
    G ––––2––0––2––0––––––––––––––2––––––––0–––––––––––––––
    D ––––3––––––––2––––––––––––––2––––––––0–––––––––––––––
    A –––––––––––––3––––––––––––––0––––––––2–––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3–––––––––––––––
          1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
          F        C              Am       G

## Lyrics w/ chords

    INTRO
      F-C-Am-G (repeat this for the whole song!)

    VERSE
                F       C    Am  G            F     C      Am  G
        Well, I started out........... down a dirty road
        F       C    Am  G       F     C   Am  G
        Started out............. all alone

                              (repeat F-C-Am-G for all verses)

        And the sun went down... as I crossed the hill
        And the town lit up... the world got still

    CHORUS
                F           C    Am  G           F         C     Am  G
            I'm learning to fly........... but I ain't got wings
            F      C     Am  G                   F       C     Am  G
            Coming down.................. is the hardest thing

                              (repeat F-C-Am-G for all choruses)

        Well the good old days may not return
        And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn

            I'm learning to fly... but I ain't got wings
            Coming down... is the hardest thing

        Well some say life will beat you down
        Break your heart, steal your crown
        So I've started out, for God knows where
        I guess I'll know when I get there

            I'm learning to fly... around the clouds
            But what goes up... must come down

            I'm learning to fly... but I ain't got wings
            Coming down... is the hardest thing

## Good luck!
