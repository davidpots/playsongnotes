## Chords needed (no capo)

The entire song uses these four chords, in this order, over and over. For the F, feel free to only play the middle four strings to make things easier:

    E ––(1)––0–––3–––0–––
    B –––1–––1–––3–––1–––
    G –––2–––0–––0–––2–––
    D –––3–––2–––0–––2–––
    A –––3–––3–––2–––0–––
    E ––(1)––––––3–––––––
         F   C   G   Am

## Chords needed (capo 5)

If you want to avoid the F chord, you can play the song with these 4 chords using a capo on the 5th fret.

    E –––0–––3–––2–––0–––
    B –––1–––0–––3–––0–––
    G –––0–––0–––2–––0–––
    D –––2–––0–––0–––2–––
    A –––3–––2–––––––2–––
    E –––––––3–––––––0–––
         C   G   D   Em

## Lyrics with chords

Using just the chorus as an example, here's how you'd play the chords along with the song:

                                 F
    I don't really, really wanna fight anymore
                                 C
    I don't really, really wanna fake it no more
                                    G
    Play me like The Beatles, baby, just let it be
                                 Am
    So come and put the blame on me, yeah

And so on.

## Strumming pattern

First, understand that we want to accept the 2 and the 4 counts. If we look at two measures (8 beats total), this would look like this:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
        D       D       D       D

From there, we'll want to mute (silence) all of the strings on the 3 count. Do this while keeping the accent on the 2 and 4 beats.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
        D   x   D       D   x   D

Next, add an up strum on the "2 +" count of each measure.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
        D U x   D       D U x   D

And from there, add an up strum to the "1 +" count.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
      U D U x   D     U D U x   D

Then, practice removing the "2" count down strum.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
      U   U x   D     U   U x   D

Finally, try mixing and matching all of the above! For example, you'll hear this on the album quite a bit:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
      U   U x   D     U D U x   D

## Good luck!
