## Chords needed

    E –––2–––––3–––––3–––(1)–––
    B –––3–––––3–––––3––––1––––
    G –––2–––––0–––––0––––2––––
    D –––0–––––2–––––0––––3––––
    A –––––––––3–––––2––––3––––
    E –––––––––––––––3–––(1)–––
         D   Cadd9   G    F

## Chord progression for the entire song

For the entire song, you'll want to use this progression from D to Cadd9 to G. Repeat it over and over:

    "Sweet wheels keep on turning..."

    D . . . Cad9 . . . G . . . G . . .

In one or two cases, you'll change this for one progression by throwing an F into the mix. You can use as simplified an F as you prefer:

    "In Birmingham they love the Governor, boo hoo..."

    D . . . Cad9 . . . G . . . F . C .

## Riffs for the main riff

There are many ways you can play this -- each has slight variations in the final measure. I'm not super interested in mapping each of these out to their exact location in the song... for that, I leave it to you to listen to the album version, watch my video, and combine these as you prefer. Also, note that some of these riffs may not be 100% accurate to what you hear in the album version -- I'm less concerned with an exact reproduction, and more concerned with giving you the structure that'll get you started with things.

## Interlude riff

This is what you hear between each verse. Again, there are a few ways you can play it. Use the method(s) that work for your needs.

## Strumming Patterns

Here's a few ways to strum it, in order of complexity (starting at the easiest version). The "\_" symbol in the patterns below designates playing the bass note of that chord, for that strum. See my video for reference for all these.

    D   .   C   .   G   .   .   .
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓

    D   .   C   .   G   .   .   .
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    ↓   ↓ ↓↑↓   ↓ ↓↑↓   ↓ ↓↑↓   ↓ ↓↑

    D   .   C   .   G   .   .   .
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    ↓ ↓ ↓   ↓ ↓ ↓   ↓ ↓ ↓   ↓ ↓ ↓
    ¯ ¯ >   ¯ ¯ >   ¯ ¯ >   ¯ ¯ >

    D   .   C   .   G   .   .   .
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

## Hope that helps!

Let me know how things work for you when learning this song! Hopefully well. Hit me up with any comments / questions / etc.
