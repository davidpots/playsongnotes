## Lyrics w/ chords

        D
    Low down leaving sun
    D7                              G
    Done, did everything that needs done
                 D               B7
    Woe is me... why can't I see...
        E7                            A7                
    I'd best be leaving well enough alone

         D
    Them neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fights
    D7                         G
    Keep a-haunting me in memo---ries
                                          D               B7
    Well, there's one in every crowd, for crying out loud...
    E7                        A7
    Why was it always turning out to be me?

    D                    
    Where does it go? The good Lord only knows
    D7                               G
    Seems like it was just the other day
                                D            B7
    I was down at Green Gables, hawking them tables
        E7                       A7
    And generally blowing all my hard earned pay

      D                         
    Piano rolled blues, danced holes in my shoes
          D7                           G
    There weren't another other way to be
                        D          B7
    For lovable losers, no account boozers
        E7         A7          D         
    And honky tonk heroes like me.... hey hey

        (start heavier strumming)

        (for remaining verses, use same chords)

    Where does it go? The good Lord only knows
    [...]

    Piano rolled blues, danced holes in my shoes
    [...]

    Where does it go? The good Lord only knows
    [...]

    Piano rolled blues, danced holes in my shoes
    [...]
