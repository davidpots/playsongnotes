## Chords w/ lyrics

    (capo 2nd fret)

      G                          C
    I went to a cobbler to fix a hole in my shoe
                D                         C                      G     C  G
    He took one look at my face and said "I can fix that hole in you"
    G                             C
    ...I beg your pardon, I'm not looking for a cure
               D                            C                      G      C  G
    I've seen enough from my friends in the depths of the God-sick blues

        G                  Am        G    
        ...You know I am a... liar-------
        G                  Am        G
        ...You know I am a... liar-------
        G                  Am        C            G    C  G
        ...Nobody helps a.... liar------------

           G                                   C
    'Cause I've been down to Dixie and dropped acid on my tongue
             D                  C            G     C  G
    Tripped upon the land 'til enough was enough
            G                        C
    I was a little bit lighter and adventure on my sleeve
            D                C                G    C  G
    I was a little drunk and looking for company
         G                                  C
    So I found myself a sweetheart with the softest of hands
              D                    C           G      C  G
    We were unlucky in love but I'd do it all again

        G                       Am         G     
        ...We built ourselves a... fire-------
        G                       Am         G     
        ...We built ourselves a... fire-------
        G                  Am        C        G     C  G
        ...You know I am a... liar-------

            G          C          G/B       Am (let ring)    G   C  G
            ...And you don't know what I've done

        G                         C
    And by the rollin' river is exactly where I was
                 D                    C        G      C  G
    There was no snake oil cure for unlucky in love
          G                           C    
    To be lonely is a habit, like smoking or taking drugs
            D                   C                  G    C  G  
    And I've quit them both but man, was it rough

        G                  Am         G
        ...And now I am...... tired-----
        G                  Am         G
        ...It just made me... tired-----
        G                          Am       G
        ...Let's build ourselves a... fire-----
        G                          Am       C       G    C  G
        ...Let's build ourselves a... fire--------

                        (repeat G-C-G as desired to end)

## How to play the chords

## Strumming pattern

Here's an easy strum to get started with. Establish your tempo (1-2-3-4), and then do downstrums on only the 1 and 3 counts.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D       D      

From there, you can mimic what Jenny Lewis plays through most of the song by doing this. Note, you'll want to keep your accent on the 1 and 3 counts, but you'll want to add a subtle "down up" on the "4 +" counts. See my video lesson for reference.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D       D   D U
    >       >      

For strumming the G-C-G sequence (heard in the intro, etc) -- refer to this mapping. Basically, you'll want to maintain the 1 and 3 accented counts, but you also need an additional up-strum on the first "3 +" count, just before switching to the C. Again, see my video lesson for reference.

    G           C   G
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D       D U D U D       D   D U
    >       >       >       >
