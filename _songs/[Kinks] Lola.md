## Lyrics w/ chords

    INTRO
        | C . . . | C . D . | E . . . | E . . . |

    VERSE
        E
        I met her in a club down in old Soho
                  A                      D
        Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like
             E               A
        Coca-cola... C-O-L-A cola

            E
        She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
          A                       D
        I asked her name and in a dark-brown voice she said
        E               A       D               C        C  D  E
        Lola... L-O-L-A Lola....... la-la-la-la Lola

        (short break, stay on the E chord)

        Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
        But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
        Oh my Lola... lo-lo-lo-lo Lola

        Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
        Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man
        Oh, my Lola... la-la-la-la Lola... la-la-la-la Lola

        (short break, stay on the E chord)

    CHORUS
                    B
            Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
            F#
            Under electric candlelight
                A
            She picked me up and sat me on her knee
                Am
            And said, "Little boy, won't you come home with me"

        Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
        But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell
        For my Lola... La-la-la-la Lola... la-la-la-la Lola

        Lola... la-la-la-la Lola... la-la-la-la Lola

        (short break, stay on the E chord)

    BRIDGE
                  A      C#m  B
                I pushed her away
                  A      C#m    B
                I walked to the door
                  A    C#m    B
                I fell to the floor
                      E    G#m   C#m
                I got down on my knees
                      B
                Well, I looked at her and she at me

        That's the way that I want it to stay
        And I'll always want it to be that way
        For my Lola... La-la-la-la Lola

        Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
        It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world
        Except for Lola... La-la-la-la Lola

            Well, I'd left home just a week before
            And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
            But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
            And said, "Little boy, I'm gonna make you a man"

        Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man
        But I know what I am and I’m glad I'm a man
        And so is Lola... La-la-la-la Lola... la-la-la-la Lola

        Lola... la-la-la-la Lola... la-la-la-la Lola
                                            (repeat & jam)

## Chords needed

Here's how to play the guitar chords used in this song. The chorus and bridge get a bit tricker with barre chords, but you can get away with simple open chords for the intro and verse sections.

    e-|---0----0----2----0----0-----0----------2-----4-----4----
    B-|---0----1----3----2----3-----1-----4----2-----5-----4----
    G-|---1----0----2----2----2-----2-----4----3-----6-----4----
    D-|---2----2----0----2----2-----2-----4----4-----6-----6----
    A-|---2----3---------0----0-----0-----2----4-----4-----6----
    E-|---0-------------------------------2----------------4----

## Extended instrumental intro riff

Lola, by The Kinks, is one of the many fantastic covers that lawyer-turned-guitarist Mike Masse covers on his excellent YouTube channel. After hearing his version so many times, I decided to work out what he is playing in the intro to the song. Here is the video of Mike's version:

While this riff I came up with isn't 100% what he plays, it's still a super fun sequence to have fun with. So, I wanted to share!
