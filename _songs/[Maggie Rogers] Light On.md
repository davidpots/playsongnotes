## Intro tab, easiest version

The easiest way to approach this is to put your hands in the chord shapes below, and simply remove & add your left index finger to the 1st fret of the 2nd string.

    E ––0––|–––––––––––––––    E ––3––|–––––––––––––––    E ––0––|–––––––––––––––
    B ––1––|––1–0––1–1––0––    B ––0––|––1–0––1–1––0––    B ––1––|––1–0––1–1––0––  <== left index finger
    G ––0––|––0–0––0–0––0––    G ––0––|––0–0––0–0––0––    G ––2––|––2–2––2–2––2––      used on this string for
    D ––2––|–––––––––––––––    D ––0––|–––––––––––––––    D ––3––|–––––––––––––––      the on/off melody note
    A ––3––|–––––––––––––––    A ––2––|–––––––––––––––    A –––––|–––––––––––––––      on all 3 chords
    E –––––|–––––––––––––––    E ––3––|–––––––––––––––    E –––––|–––––––––––––––
        C                          G                        Fmaj7       

## Intro tab, advanced

Here's the full tab, with the pulsing bass notes.

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –––––1–––––0–––––1–––––1–––0–––––––––1–––––0–––––1–––––1–––0–––––––––1–––––0–––––1–––––1–––0–––––––––1–––––0–––––1–––––1–––0–––––
    G –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0–––0–––––––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0–––0–––––––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0–––0–––––––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0–––0–––––
    D –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3–––––––––––3–––––––3–––––––3–––1–––––––––––1–––––––1–––––––1–––1–––––––––––1–––––––1–––––––1–––
       C                               G                               Fmaj7                           Fmaj7
       1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a

Here's the timing chart I used when training my fingers to play their parts independently. I practice this by rhythmically knocking my right-hand thumb and index/middle fingers against a table (or steering wheel, or my pants, etc) until I could do the pattern without thinking about it. Then, I translated it to guitar (with my left hand doing the fretting and chord changes). It was hard, but I got it. If you want to learn this, have patience!

    Melody rhythm => |     O     0     O     O   0     |         O = index finger on
                     | 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a |         0 = index finger off
    Thumb rhythm  => | x           x       x       x   |

## Lyrics w/ chords

Capo 2nd fret.

    VERSE
                C
    Would you believe me now...
         G                             Fmaj7
    If I told you I got caught up in a wave, almost gave it away
              C
    Would you hear me out...     
         G                            Fmaj7             
    If I told you I was terrified for days, thought I was gonna break

    PRE-CHORUS

        Am                               G
        Oh, I couldn't stop it, tried to slow it all down
        Fmaj7
        Crying in the bathroom, had to figure it out
             Am                        G                Fmaj7
        With everyone around me saying, "You must be so happy now"

    CHORUS
                            C                            G
            Oh, if you keep reaching out, then I'll keep coming back
                          Fmaj7
            And if you're gone for good, then I'm okay with that
            Am                           G          Em                 Fmaj7
            ...If you leave the light on, then I'll leave the light on

## Best videos of this song

This is my favorite. Solo acoustic guitar, all shot in one live take, her friends singing the chorus as a group. Released the week before her first album goes out into the world. So happy for her.

There's also her SNL performance which I'll include for fun. Less acoustic, but still good I think:

And finally, here's the Spotify Singles version of this song, which has a great acoustic vibe:
