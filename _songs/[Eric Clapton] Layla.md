## Intro riff

First up, note that I am using these chord shapes for the riff. Notably, I am simplifying things by playing only 3 strings per each chord. The notes below in paranthesis I'm not playing - you can if you wish, but note it makes things tougher for you.

The idea is to spend two counts on each chord, in the order shown below. Then repeat.

    E ––––(1)––––––––––––––––(1)––––
    B –––––3––––(3)––––(5)––––3–––––
    G –––––2–––––3––––––5–––––2–––––
    D –––––0–––––3––––––5–––––0–––––
    A –––––––––––1––––––3–––––––––––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
           Dm    Bb     C     Dm

Here's the tab for the generalized riff:

    E –––––––––(1)–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––(1)––––––
    B ––––––––––3––––––––––––(3)––––––––––––(5)–––––––––––––––3–––––––
    G ––––––––––2–––––––––––––3––––––––––––––5––––––––––––––––2–––––––
    D ––––––––––0––––––0––––––3––––––––––––––5––––––––––––––––0–––––––
    A ––––0––3––––––––––––3–––1–––––––1––1–––3–––––––––0––3–––––––––––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
                Dm            Bb             C                Dm

When first learning this, I recommend practicing just the bass notes first. For each bass note, be sure to use left-hand fingers that allow you to play the chords you'll need. This way, when you're fluent enough with the bass notes, you can work on bringing in the full chords.

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –––––––––(3)–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––(3)––––––
    G –––––––––(2)–––––––––––(3)––––––––––––(5)––––––––––––––(2)––––––
    D ––––––––––0––––––0–––––(3)––––––––––––(5)–––––––––––––––0–––––––
    A ––––0––3––––––––––––3–––1––––––––––––––3–––––––––0––3–––––––––––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
                Dm            Bb             C                Dm

To transition into the verse, end the riff as follows:

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––––––––3–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    G ––––––––––2–––––––––––––3––––––––––––––5––––––––––––2–––5–––––––
    D ––––––––––0––––––0––––––3–––––––3––3–––5––––––x–x–––2–––5–––––––
    A ––––0––3––––––––––––3–––1–––––––1––1–––3––––––x–x–––0–––3–––––––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
                Dm            Bb             C            Am  C   

## Lyrics w/ chords

    (intro, played with riff):

    Dm   Bb   C   Dm     x3
    Dm   Bb   C   Am  C  x1

    C#m7                           G#7
    ...What'll you do when you get lonely
    C#m7         C       D       E      E7  
    And nobody's waiting by your side
    F#m            B           E               A
    ...You've been running and hiding much too long
    F#m              B                 E        A
    ...You know it's just your foolish pride... Lay----

           Dm   Bb           C            Dm
        Layla........ you've got me on my knees
           Dm   Bb         C                Dm
        Layla......... I'm begging, darling please
           Dm   Bb     C                 Dm              
        Layla......... darling won't you ease my worried
        Dm      Bb     C       Am   C
        Mind....

    I tried to give you consolation
    When your old man had let you down
    Like a fool, I fell in love with you
    Turned my whole world upside down

        Layla, you've got me on my knees
        Layla, I'm begging, darling please
        Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind

    Let's make the best of the situation
    Before I finally go insane
    Please don't say I'll never find a way
    And tell me all my love's in vain

        Layla, you've got me on my knees
        Layla, I'm begging, darling please
        Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind

## Advanced notes about the intro riff

Here's the actual timing of the first line of the riff, as heard in the recorded Clapton version:

    E |–––––––––––––|––––––––––––––––––––––––––|––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–
    B |––––––––––3––|––––––––––(3)–––––––––(5)–|–––––––––––3–––––––––––3––|–
    G |––––––––––2––|–––––––––––3–––––––––––5––|–––––––––––2–––––––––––2––|–
    D |––––––––––0––|–––––0–––––3–––––––––––5––|–––––––––––0–––––––––––0––|–
    A |––––0––3–––––|––––––––3––1–––––1––1––3––|–––––3––3––––––––0––3–––––|–
    E |–––––––––––––|––––––––––––––––––––––––––|––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–
                 Dm             Bb          C              Dm          Dm
           +  4  +     1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +     1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  

Note that the 2nd and 3rd time he plays this, the timing slightly changes. For example, the C comes in on the "1" count of next measure the 2nd time it is played:

    E |–––––––––––––|––––––––––––––––––––––––––|––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–
    B |––––––––––3––|––––––––––(3)–––––––––––––|–(5)–––––––3–––––––––––3––|–
    G |––––––––––2––|–––––––––––3––––––––––––––|––5––––––––2–––––––––––2––|–
    D |––––––––––0––|–––––0–––––3––––––––––––––|––5––––––––0–––––––––––0––|–
    A |––––0––3–––––|––––––––3––1––––––––––––––|––3––0––3––––––––0––3–––––|–
    E |–––––––––––––|––––––––––––––––––––––––––|––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–
                 Dm             Bb                C        Dm          Dm
           +  4  +     1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +     1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  

And the third time it is played, he slides up from the Bb to C shape. Listen along for reference, and watch my video lesson to see me play each version.
