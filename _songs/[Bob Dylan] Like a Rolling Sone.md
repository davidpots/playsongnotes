## How to play the chords

Here's how to use open chords (easiest way). See my video for some easier ways to play the F, if that's tough for you.

    E ––––0––––1––––0––––1––––3––––
    B ––––1––––3––––0––––1––––0––––
    G ––––0––––2––––0––––2––––0––––
    D ––––2––––0––––2––––3––––0––––
    A ––––3–––––––––2––––3––––2––––
    E ––––––––––––––0––––1––––3––––
          C    Dm   Em   F    G

Or you can use barre chords:

    E ––––––3–––––––5–––––––7–––––––8––––––10––––––––––
    B ––––––5–––––––6–––––––8––––––10––––––12––––––––––
    G ––––––5–––––––7–––––––9––––––10––––––12––––––––––
    D ––––––5–––––––7–––––––9––––––10––––––12––––––––––
    A ––––––3–––––––5–––––––7–––––––8––––––10––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
