## Editor's notes

Simple version below, meant to get folks started with this song. The more musically astute among you will notice some corners I may have cut in some of the very minor details with the intro riff's tab. I also am using standard chord shapes for the verse/chorus chords (where I believe Pink Floyd likely plays inversions of these chords, such as C/G and D/F#).

## Chords needed

## Lyrics w/ chords

    C                           D
    ...So, so you think you can tell
                Am                    G
    Heaven from hell, blue skies from pain
                         D                       C
    Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail
                   Am                          G
    A smile from a veil?  Do you think you can tell

                        C                     D
    Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts
                  Am                   G
    Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze
                     D                 C
    Cold comfort for change, did you exchange
                          Am                       G
    A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage

    C                                  D
    ...How I wish, how I wish you were here
               Am                                     G
    We’re just two lost souls swimmin’ in a fish bowl, year after year
    D                                   C
    ... Running over the same old ground... what have we found
                 Am                       G
    The same old fears... I wish you were here
