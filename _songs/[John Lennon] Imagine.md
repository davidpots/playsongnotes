## Video lesson

In this lesson I'll teach you how to play "Imagine" by John Lennon on the acoustic guitar. I'll show you the intro & verse riff, explain the chords, demonstrate the strumming patterns, and teach you how to add some fun flourish to various chords in order to capture Lennon's piano sound. I hope you enjoy!
