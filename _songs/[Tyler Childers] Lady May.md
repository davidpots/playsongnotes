                C       C         F      C      F             C       Am G/B  C        

    VERSE
              C                                      F                C
        I'm a stone's throw from the mill, and I'm a good walk to the river
                F              C              Am       G/B    C
        When my working day is over, we'll go swim our cares away
                 C                           F                 C
        Put your toes down in the water, and smile across your face
            F                C        Am     G/B   C
        And tell me that you love me, lovely Lady May

    CHORUS
                  Am        G/B      C                F               C
            Now I ain't the sharpest chisel that your hands have ever held
                F                     C                 Am      G/B       C
            But darlin' I could love you well, 'til the roll is called on high
                Am       G/B      C                 F                 C
            I've seen my share of trouble, and I've held my weight in shame
                     F                C     Am     G/B  C
            But I am baptized in your name, lovely Lady May

    VERSE
                 C                                  F                C
        Lord the wind can leave you shivering as it waltzes over the leaves
                  F                  C                Am           G/B    C
        It's been rushing through my timber 'til your love brought on the spring
                C                                   F                  C
        Now the mountains all are blushin, and they don't know what to say
                 F                 C              Am     G/B   C
        Except a good long line of praises for my lovely Lady May

    CHORUS
                  Am        G/B      C                 F            C
            Now I ain't the toughest hickory that your axe has ever fell
                      F               C           Am      G/B     C
            But I'm a hickory just as well, I'm a hickory all the same
                   Am       G/B         C             F            C
            I came crashing through the forest as you cut my roots away
                  F                C            Am     G/B  C
            And I fell a good long ways, for my lovely Lady May

## Intro (simple version)

Here's the main melody notes of the intro. In this simplified version, I'm not including any of the hammer-ons or pull-offs. Don't worry about adding those until you have this foundation memorized.

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    G ––––––––––––––––––––––––0–2–––––––––––––2–0–––––––––––––––––––––––––0––
    D ––2–0–––––––0–0–2–2–0–3––––––––––0–2––3–––––2––––0–2––––––––––––0–2––––
    A ––––––3–3–3–––––––––––––––––––3–––––––––––––––3–––––––0–––2–––3––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
            C       C       F       C       F       C       Am G/B  C        
            1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

Also, while learning the melody riff above, understand that these are the chord shapes you'll want to have your left hand in while playing (if you can manage it). This sets you up nicely for doing full strums of any of these chords should you want to dial-down the riff and amp-up the rhythm strumming.

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––––1–––––––1–––––––1–––––––1–––––––1–––––––1–––––––1–––0–––1––––––––
    G ––––––0–––––––0–––––––2–––––––0–––––––2–––––––0–––––––2–––0–––0––––––––
    D ––––––2–––––––2–––––––3–––––––2–––––––3–––––––2–––––––2–––0–––2––––––––
    A ––––––3–––––––3–––––––––––––––3–––––––––––––––3–––––––0–––2–––3––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
            C       C       F       C       F       C       Am G/B  C         
            1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

## Intro (w/ nuance)

Here's the main melody notes of the intro. Here, I'm showing the hammer-ons and pull-offs that you hear on the album version of the song.

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––1––
    G –––––––––––––––––––––––––––0h2––––––––––0h2–0––––––––––––––––––––––––––––0––
    D ––2p0–––––––0–0h2––2p0––3––––––––0h2––3–––––––0h2p0––––0h2–––––––––––0h2––––
    A ––––––3–3–3–––3––––––––(3)–––––3–––––(3)––––––––––––3––3––––0––0h2––3–––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––(1)–––––––––––(1)––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
            C       C         F      C      F             C       Am G/B  C        

And, understand these are the implied chord shapes played underneath. Sometimes you may want to lean into plucking strings from these chords while you're making your way through the riff. Listen to Tyler Childer's version - you'll hear him sneak in occasional notes from these chords, as no doubt his hands are in these chord positions as he moves his way through.

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––––1–––––––1–––––––––1––––––1––––––1–––––––––––––1–––––––1–––0–––1–––––––
    G ––––––0–––––––0–––––––––2––––––0––––––2–––––––––––––0–––––––2–––0–––0–––––––
    D ––––––2–––––––2–––––––––3––––––2––––––3–––––––––––––2–––––––2–––0–––2–––––––
    A ––––––3–––––––3––––––––(3)–––––3–––––(3)––––––––––––3–––––––0–––2–––3–––––––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
            C       C         F      C      F             C       Am G/B  C       

## How to play the chords

Here's how to play the chords used in this song -- including a few simplified ways to play the F chord (you don't need to play all 6 strings to make it work).

    Main chord shapes:                 Simplified F positions:
    E –––0––––1––––0––––––––           –––––   –––––   –––––
    B –––1––––1––––1––––0–––           ––1––   ––1––   –––––
    G –––0––––2––––2––––0–––           ––2––   ––2––   ––2––
    D –––2––––3––––2––––0–––           ––3––   ––3––   ––3––
    A –––3––––3––––0––––2–––           –––––   ––3––   ––3––
    E ––––––––1–––––––––––––           –––––   –––––   ––1––
         C    F    Am  G/B               F       F       F

## Mastering the hammer-on technique

A crucial part to playing this song like Tyler Childers is being able to hammer on your left-middle finger on both the C and F chords. Here are some tabs that break this down to its simplest form. For each chord below, I show the "normal" way to play the chord, and then show the tab for the hammer-on note you can add with your left-hand middle finger.

    E –––––––––––––         E ––––––––––––––
    B –––1––––1––––         B –––1–––––1––––
    G –––0––––0––––         G –––2–––––0h2––
    D –––2––––0h2––         D –––3–––––3––––
    A –––3––––3––––         A ––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––         E ––––––––––––––
         C    C*                 F     F*

## Good luck!
