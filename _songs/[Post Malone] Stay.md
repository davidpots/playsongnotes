## Verse riff

    G –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

## Chords needed

Here's how to play the chords used in the song (the way Post Malone plays them). Note, these can be a bit difficult - especially the F, Fm, and Dm7.

    E –––0–––––1–––––0–––––0–––––1––––
    B –––1–––––1–––––0–––––1–––––1––––
    G –––2–––––1–––––0–––––0–––––2––––
    D –––2–––––3–––––2–––––2–––––0––––
    A –––x–––––3–––––3–––––0––––––––––
    E –––1–––––1–––––3––––––––––––––––
       Fmaj7   Fm  Cmaj7  Am7   Dm7

If you want some easier alternatives to these chords, try these out. Much more conventional, limited barre chords, etc. Specifically, the F and Fm chords require only a few strings. Also, the Dm7 is swapped out for a common D-minor chord. The song will still sound just fine if you use these.

    E –––0–––––1–––––0–––––0–––––1––––
    B –––1–––––1–––––0–––––1–––––3––––
    G –––2–––––1–––––0–––––2–––––2––––
    D –––3–––––––––––2–––––2–––––0––––
    A –––––––––––––––3–––––0––––––––––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
       Fmaj7   Fm  Cmaj7   Am    Dm

## Strumming pattern

    1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a
    D       D   D U   U D     U D U

## Lyrics w/ Chords

VERSE
It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

PRE-CHORUS
Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

CHORUS
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to...

VERSE
Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is faded
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

PRE-CHORUS
But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

CHORUS
Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

## Good luck!
