## How to play the chords

Here's how I play the chords:

    E –––0––––0––––3––––0––––––0–––––
    B –––2––––0––––0––––3––––––1–––––
    G –––2––––0––––0––––0––––––0–––––
    D –––2––––2––––0––––4––––––2–––––
    A –––0––––2––––2––––5––––––3–––––
    E ––––––––0––––3–––––––––––––––––
         A    Em   G   Dsus2   C   

For the Dsus2, you have some other options depending on your taste. Pick one to suit you. It looks like she may play the D/A style chord:          

    E ––––0––––––0––––
    B ––––3––––––3––––
    G ––––2––––––0––––
    D ––––0––––––4––––
    A –––––––––––5––––
    E –––––––––––5––––
        Dsus2   D/A

## Chords progression

Most of the song uses this progression:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    A               Em              G               Dsus2

Sometimes, she'll swap out the E minor and play a C instead, such as:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    A               C               G               Dsus2

## Strumming pattern

To keep it very easy, start with all down strums:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D   D

If you want to take it further, add an accent to the "3" count. See my video lesson for reference.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D   D
            >

Next, if you wish, add alternating up-strums between each down strum. Keep the accent on the 3!

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D U D U D U D U
            >

## Good luck!

Thanks for reading! I hope this helped you.
