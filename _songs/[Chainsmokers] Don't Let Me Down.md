## Playing the chords

#### No capo

    E ||––––0–––––––––2––––4––––
    B ||––––0––––4––––2––––4––––
    G ||––––1––––4––––3––––4––––
    D ||––––2––––4––––4––––6––––

    E ||––––0–––––––––2––––4––––
            E    B    F#   G#m

#### Capo 2nd fret

Note that the capo becomes "fret zero," such that playing the 3rd fret in the tabs below means 3 frets up from the capo.

    E ||––––2–––––––––3––––2––––
    B ||––––3––––2––––0––––2––––
    G ||––––2––––2––––0––––2––––

    E ||––––––––––––––3––––2––––
            D    A    G   F#m

#### Capo 4nd fret

Again, note that the capo becomes "fret zero," such that playing the 3rd fret in the tabs below means 3 frets up from the capo.

    E ||––––0––––3––––2––––0––––
    B ||––––1––––0––––3––––0––––
    G ||––––0––––0––––2––––0––––
    D ||––––2––––0––––0––––2––––

    E ||–––––––––3–––––––––0––––
            C    G    D    Em
