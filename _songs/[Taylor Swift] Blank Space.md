## Lyrics & chords

    VERSE

    Nice to meet you, where you been... I could show you incredible things
    Magic, madness, heaven, sin... Saw you there and I thought,
    Oh my God, look at that face, you look like my next mistake
    Love's a game, want to play?

    New money, suit and tie... I can read you like a magazine
    Ain't it funny, rumors fly... and I know you heard about me
    So hey, let's be friends... I'm dying to see how this one ends
    Grab your passport and my hand
    (I can make the bad guys good for a weekend)

        CHORUS

        So it's gonna be forever... or it's gonna go down in flames
        You can tell me when it's over... if the high was worth the pain
        Got a long list of ex-lovers... they'll tell you I'm insane
        'Cause you know I love the players... and you love the game

        'Cause we're young & we're reckless... we'll take this way too far
        It'll leave you breathless... or with a nasty scar
        Got a long list of ex-lovers... they'll tell you I'm insane
        But I've got a blank space baby... and I'll write your name

    Cherry lips, crystal skies... I could show you incredible things
    Stolen kisses, pretty lies... you're the king baby I'm your Queen
    Find out, what you want... be that girl for a month
    Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no

    Screaming, crying, perfect storm... I can make all the tables turn
    Rose gardens filled with thorns... keep you second guessing like
    "Oh my God, who is she?" ... I get drunk on jealousy
    But you'll come back each time you leave
    ('Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream)

        So it's gonna be forever... or it's gonna go down in flames
        You can tell me when it's over... if the high was worth the pain
        Got a long list of ex-lovers... they'll tell you I'm insane
        'Cause you know I love the players... and you love the game

        'Cause we're young & we're reckless... we'll take this way too far
        It'll leave you breathless... or with a nasty scar
        Got a long list of ex-lovers... they'll tell you I'm insane
        But I've got a blank space baby... and I'll write your name

            BRIDGE

            Boys only want love if it's torture
            Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
            Boys only want love if it's torture
            Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya

        So it's gonna be forever... or it's gonna go down in flames
        You can tell me when it's over... if the high was worth the pain
        Got a long list of ex-lovers... they'll tell you I'm insane
        'Cause you know I love the players... and you love the game

        'Cause we're young & we're reckless... we'll take this way too far
        It'll leave you breathless... or with a nasty scar
        Got a long list of ex-lovers... they'll tell you I'm insane
        But I've got a blank space baby... and I'll write your name
