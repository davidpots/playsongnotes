    BRIDGE
                (use power chords)

                B               B/Bb          E            G
                ...Like father... stepfather... the son is drowning in the...

                C#m    G#   A            E             C#m  G#  A  E
                Flood--------- yeah yeah... yeah yeah...

                (repeat main chord progression, solo as desired)

## Chords used

Most of the song, except for the bridge, uses these 4 chords in this order (repeating):

    E ||––––4–––  ––––4––––  ––––5––––  ––––0––––
    B ||––––5–––  ––––4––––  ––––5––––  ––––0––––
    G ||––––6–––  ––––5––––  ––––6––––  ––––1––––
    D ||––––6–––  ––––6––––  ––––7––––  ––––2––––
    A ||––––4–––  ––––6––––  ––––7––––  ––––2––––
    E ||––––––––  ––––4––––  ––––5––––  ––––0––––
           C#m        G#         A          E    

The timing is generally as follows. Note this is a group of 3 beats, then 5 beats, then 3 beats, then 5 beats. As opposed to all measures being 4 beats equally.

    C#m         G#                  A           E
    /   /   /   /   /   /   /   /   /   /   /   /   /   /   /   /   
    1   2   3   4   1   2   3   4   1   2   3   4   1   2   3   4

The chorus is the only section (which uses these chords) that violates this timing principle just above.

## Main riff

Play this twice. The final time you play it, let the final E-major chord ring.

    E ||–––4–––––4–x–x–––4–––––––––––––––––––––––5–x–x–––0––––––––––––––––––
    B ||–––4h5–––5–x–x–––4–––––––––––––0–––––––––5–x–x–––0––––––––––––––––––
    G ||–––4–––––4–x–x–––5–––––––––––5–––––5/6–––6–x–x–––1–––––––––––9\–––––
    D ||–––4h6–––6–x–x–––6–––––––––6–––––––6/7–––7–x–x–––2–––––––––––9\–––––
    A ||–––4–––––––––––––6–––––––6–––––––––6/7–––––––––––2––––––9h11––––––––
    E ||–––––––––––––––––4–––4–––––––––––––4/5–––––––––––0–––0––––––––––––––
           C#m           G#                  A           E

## Verse chords, full strum

    E –|–––4––––––––––4––––––––––––––––5–––––––––––0––––––––––––––––|–
    B –|–––5––x––x––––4––––––––––––––––5–––––––––––0––––––––––––––––|–
    G –|–––6––x––x––––5––x––x––x––x––––6––x––x–––––1––x––x––x––x––––|–
    D –|–––6––x––x––––6––x––x––x––x––––7––x––x–––––2––x––x––x––x––––|–
    A –|–––4––x––x––––6––x––x––x––x––––7––x––x–––––2––x––x––x––x––––|–
    E –|––––––––––––––4––x––x––x––x––––5––x––x–––––0––x––x––x––x––––|–
           C#m        G#               A           E

## Chorus

Repeat this same progression:

    "...Say it ain't so..."

    E ||––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ||––(5)–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    G ||–––6––6–––x–x–x–x–––(5)––––––––––––––(6)––––––––––(1)–––––––––––––––––
    D ||–––6––6–––x–x–x–x––––6––6––x–x–x–x––––7––7––x–x––––2––x–x–x–x–x–x–x–––
    A ||–––4––4–––x–x–x–x––––6––6––x–x–x–x––––7––7––x–x––––2––x–x–x–x–x–x–x–––
    E ||–––––––––––––––––––––4––4––x–x–x–x––––5––5––x–x––––0––x–x–x–x–x–x–x–––
           C#m               G#               A            E

If you want, you can add that final riff at the end:

    E -|––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B -|––(5)–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    G -|–––6––6–––x–x–x–x–––(5)––––––––––––––(6)––––––––––(1)–––––––––––––9\––
    D -|–––6––6–––x–x–x–x––––6––6––x–x–x–x––––7––7––x–x––––2–––x–x––––––––9\––
    A -|–––4––4–––x–x–x–x––––6––6––x–x–x–x––––7––7––x–x––––2–––x–x–––9h11–––––
    E -|–––––––––––––––––––––4––4––x–x–x–x––––5––5––x–x––––0–––x–x–0––––––––––
           C#m               G#               A            E

You can also emulate the sloppy electric guitar wail, by leaving the top two strings open:

    "...Say it ain't so..."

    E –|––––––––––0–0––––––––––––––0–0––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –|––––––––––0–0––––––––––––––0–0––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    G –|–––6––6––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––(6)––––––––––(1)–––––––––––––––––
    D –|–––6––6––––––––––––––6––6–––––––––––––7––7––x–x––––2––x–x–x–x–x–x–x–––
    A –|–––4––4––––––––––––––6––6–––––––––––––7––7––x–x––––2––x–x–x–x–x–x–x–––
    E –|–––––––––––––––––––––4––4–––––––––––––5––5––x–x––––0––x–x–x–x–x–x–x–––
           C#m               G#               A            E

The final time you play the progression, it's good to let all the chords sound loudly.

    "...My love is a life taker..."

    E –|–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –|–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    G –|–––6––6––6––6–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––9––9––9––9––9––––––
    D –|–––6––6––6––6––––––6––6––6––6––6–––––7––7––7––––––9––9––9––9––9––––––
    A –|–––4––4––4––4––––––6––6––6––6––6–––––7––7––7––––––7––7––7––7––7––––––
    E –|–––––––––––––––––––4––4––4––4––4–––––5––5––5––––––0––0––0––0––0––––––
           C#m             G#                A            E

## Bridge

Repeat this progression:

    "Dear Daddy... I write you... in spite of years of silence..."

    E ||–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–
    B ||–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–
    G ||–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–
    D ||–––9––9––x––9–––––8––8––x––8–––––2––2––x––2––––––5––5––x––5––––|–
    A ||–––9––9––x––9–––––9––9––x––9–––––2––2––x––2––––––5––5––x––5––––|–
    E ||–––7––7––x––7–––––6––6––x––6–––––0––0––x––0––––––3––3––x––3––––|–
           B              B/Bb           E               G

I'm pretty sure Weezer plays it more like this. Me, I don't prefer this fashion, hence the version above. Ultimately, it's the same notes –– take your pick.

    E ||–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–
    B ||–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–
    G ||–––4––4––X––4–––––4––4––X––4–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–
    D ||–––4––4––x––4–––––4––4––x––4–––––2––2––x––2––––––5––5––x––5––––|–
    A ||–––2––2––x––2–––––1––1––x––1–––––2––2––x––2––––––5––5––x––5––––|–
    E ||–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––0––0––x––0––––––3––3––x––3––––|–
           B              B/Bb           E               G

## Verse strum, reggae style

If you want to emulate the second guitar on the album version, play this -- where you're emphasizing these chord shapes on the up-strum. The other (lead) guitar can play the main riff on top of this and it sounds very nice.

    E –|–––x––4––x––4––x––4––x––4––x––5––x––4––x––4––x––4–––|–
    B –|–––x––5––x––4––x––4––x––4––x––5––x––5––x––5––x––5–––|–
    G –|–––x––6––x––5––x––5––x––5––x––6––x––4––x––4––x––4–––|–
    D –|–––x––6––x––6––x––6––x––6––x––7––x––6––x––6––x––6–––|–
    A –|––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–
    E –|––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–
             C#m    G#                A     E

## Good luck!

Let me know if you have questions. I hope this was helpful.
