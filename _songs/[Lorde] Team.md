## Chords w/ lyrics

    (capo 6th fret)

    INTRO
        (no chords, see below for tab)
        Wait 'til you’re announced
        We’ve not yet lost all our graces
        The hounds will stay in chains

        Look upon your greatness that you'll
        Send the call out, send the call out
        Send the call out, send the call out  
                             (...repeat as desired)

    VERSE
        C
        ...Call all the ladies out
        C
        ...They’re in their finery
        Am
        ...A hundred jewels on throats
        G
        ...A hundred jewels between teeth

        C
        ...Now bring my boys in
        C
        ...Their skin in craters like the moon
        Am
        ...The moon we love like a brother
        G
        ...While he glows through the room

    PRE-CHORUS
            C
            Dancing around the lies we tell
            C
            Dancing around big eyes as well
               Am
            Oh-ohhhh... even the comatose
            G (let ring)
            ...They don’t dance and tell

    CHORUS
                F                     Am                             G
                ...We live in cities..... you'll never see on screen
                G                                           Am
                ...Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run free
                F                       Am                          G
                ...Living in the ruins..... of the palace within my dreams
                G                                      F
                ...And you know, we're on each other's team

    REFRAIN
                    (quiet strumming)
                    F              Am
                    ...I'm kind of over getting told
                                G
                    To throw my hands up in the air... so there

        (normal strumming)
        C
        ...So all the cups got broke
        C
        ...Shards beneath our feet
        Am                          G
        ...But it wasn’t my fault...

        C
        ...And everyone’s competing
        C                           Am
        ...For a love they won't receive
        Am                         G (let ring)
        ...'Cause what this palace wants... is release

                F                     Am                             G
                ...We live in cities..... you'll never see on screen
                G                                           Am
                ...Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run free
                F                       Am                          G
                ...Living in the ruins..... of the palace within my dreams
                G                                      F

                    F              Am
                    ...I'm kind of over getting told
                                G
                    To throw my hands up in the air... so there
                    F            Am
                    ...I’m kinda older than I was
                             G
                    When I reveled without a care... so there

                (normal strumming)
                F                     Am                             G

                F                       Am                          G
                ...Living in the ruins..... of the palace within my dreams

## Notes and tabs

### Capo 6th Fret, Standard Tuning
If you want to play along with the Lorde album version of this song, you'll need to put a capo on the 6th fret and use the chords shown here. You can certainly play this song without a capo, but if you use the chords I show here you'll be in a different key from Lorde's version -- which is fine unless you plan on playing along with her.

### Guitar Chords Used
Here is how to play the guitar chords used in this song. Note, the Lorde recording doesn't use a guitar, so I'm basing these solely off the tonal implications heard in her recording.

    e-|---0----3----0----1----
    B-|---1----0----1----1----
    G-|---0----0----2----2----
    D-|---2----0----2----3----
    A-|---3----2----0----3----
    E-|--------3---------1----
          C    G    Am   F

### Strumming Pattern
There is a very distinct strumming pattern that works well with this song, which I carefully explain in my video lesson. The trick is to combine your accented strum on the "1" (one) and "2+" (two-and) beats, while adding a percussive slap/chop on the "2 and "4" beats. Again, I recommend watching my video lesson to see/hear this in action. Here is a crude text representation of this pattern, showing both components:

    v = strum!
    x = muted chop/slap

    v        v              v        v             v        v
    ======================================================================
    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  + 1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +    ...etc
    ======================================================================
          x           x           x           x          x           x

### Intro Guitar Tab
Here's how to play the intro, which Lorde sings over. These notes match the notes she sings. Check out the Juliana cover (below) to see/hear this played with the singing.
