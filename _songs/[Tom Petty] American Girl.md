    VERSE
        D                    E
        ...Well, she was an American girl
        G            A
        ...Raised on promises
        D                    E
        ...She couldn't help thinking that there
              G                    A
        Was a little more to life, somewhere else

    PRE-CHORUS

            ...After all it was a great big world

                ...She was... an American girl

        Well, it was kinda cold that night
        She was standing alone on her balcony
        Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
        Out on 441, like waves crashin' on the beach

            And for one desperate moment there
            He crept back in her memory
            God, it's so painful, something that's so close
            Is still so far out of reach

                Oh yeah, alright
                Take it easy baby, make it last all night
                She was... an American girl
