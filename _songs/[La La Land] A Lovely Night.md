## Capo on 3rd fret

This lets you play with standard chords in the shape of the C family -- which is much easier than dealing with chords in the family of E-flat! Note, for the other La La Land lessons I've done – I've also used capo 3. Again, for the simplest possible way to play these songs (along with the movie / soundtrack), this is the best bet in my opinion.

## Lyrics and chords

    CAPO 3rd FRET

        C             Caug      Dm                 Ddim
    The sun is nearly gone, the lights are turning on
      E                 Am        G/B    C
    A silver shine that stretches to the sea
       C             Caug         Dm                Ddim
    We stumbled on a view, that's tailored made for two
           E           Am      G/B     C
    What a shame those two are you and me

             Dm             G            C                  A7
        Some other girl and guy... would love this swirling sky
                    Dm           G        C         E
        But there's only you and I... and we've got no shot

            F                G            Em               A7
            This could never be... you're not the type for me
                        Dm              G    
            And there's not a spark in sight
            C         Dm         G      C          F#m   Badd6
            What a... waste of a lovely night

        E                   Eaug       F#m                  F#dim
    You say there's nothing here, well let's make something clear
      G#                C#m    B/D#      E
    I think I'll be the one to make that call
        E                    Eaug         F#m       F#dim
    And though you looked so cute in your polyester suit
           G#               C#m      B/D#   E
    You're right, I'd never fall for you at all

            F#m          B         E              C#7
        And maybe this appeals, to someone not in heels
              F#m          B                E               G#
        Or to any girl who feels... there's some chance for romance

            A                         B
            But.. I'm frankly feeling nothing
                    A                            B
            Is that so? or it could be less than nothing
                    A             B
            Good to know! So you agree? That's right
            A                 B                E
            What a waste of a lovely night

                E / Eaug / F#m / F#dim / G# / / / / F#m Badd6 / E

## C-augmented and D-diminished chords

"Simple" way to play:

         C    Caug     Dm     Ddim

More melodic (advanced) way to play:

    B –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    G –––––––0h2–––1––2–––––––––––1h2––1––2––

         C        Caug      D         Ddim

## E-augmented and F#-diminished chords

On the E chords, use your index and middle fingers on the B and G strings.

For the F# chords, use your middle finger on the low E string. Use your ring and pinky fingers on the B and G strings (and use your index finger on the 1st fret of the B string). Your pinky is the only finger moving as you switch between F#m and F#-dim.

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –––0–––––1–––––––2–––––––1–––––

    E –––0–––––0–––––––2–––––––2–––––
         E    Eaug    F#m    F#dim

## Other chords

Aside from the diminished and augmented chords, here's how to play all other chords you'll need.

### Verse 1

This is the verse that's in the key of C (assuming your'e using a capo on 3rd fret... technically it's in the key of E-flat).

    E –––0––––1––––3––––0––––1––––0––––––––––––––––
    B –––1––––3––––0––––2––––1––––0––––1–––––3–––––
    G –––0––––2––––0––––0––––2––––1––––2–––––0–––––
    D –––2––––0––––0––––2––––3––––2––––2–––––0–––––
    A –––3–––––––––2––––0––––3––––2––––0–––––2–––––
    E –––––––––––––3–––––––––1––––0––––––––––––––––
         C    Dm   G    A7   F    E    Am   G/B

### Verse 2

This is the verse in the key of E. More barre chords here. More difficult for sure. If you can't play these but want to perform the entire song, just re-use all the chords from verse 1 (i.e., don't change the key).

    E ––0–––4–––––––––5–––7––––2––––4––––6–––––
    B ––0–––4––––4––––5–––7––––2––––5––––6–––––
    G ––1–––5––––4––––6–––8––––3––––6––––6–––––
    D ––2–––6––––4––––7–––9––––4––––6––––––––––
    A ––2–––6––––6––––7–––9––––4––––4––––––––––
    E ––0–––4–––––––––5–––7––––2–––––––––––––––
        E   G#  B/D#  A   B   F#m  C#m  Badd6
