## Marin riff

Here's the main riff you hear, which is repeated in the intro and verse.

    e –|––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3––3––3––3––|–
    B –|––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3––3––3––3––|–
    G –|–––––2––––––––2–––––2–––––––––––––––––0––0––0––0––|–
    D –|––0–––––––––––2–––––2––––––––4––––––––0––0––0––0––|–
    A –|–––––––––––0–––––0–––––0––2–––––––––––2––2––2––2––|–
    E –|––––––––3–––––––––––––––––––––––2––3––3––3––3––3––|–
          1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
          D        A              Bm       G

## Alternate ending to the riff

And, here's the version of the riff with the special ending, heard on the 3rd playthrough of the intro. For the 4th playthrough, they go back to the "main" riff shown above.

    e –|–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3––––––––|–
    B –|–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3––––––––|–
    G –|–––––2––––––––2–––––2––––––––0–––––––––––0––––––––|–

    A –|–––––––––––0–––––0–––––0––2––––––––––––––2––0h2–––|–
    E –|––––––––3–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3––3––––––––|–
          1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
          D        A              Bm       G

## How to practice the riff when learning it

Here's what I practiced over and over while first learning the riff. The focus here is learning (1) the chords, and (2) the bass note transitions. Don't worry about the timing (yet) and don't worry about the precise melodic bass notes (yet). Once you get this down, then you can worry about those.

    e –|–––––2–––  –––––––––––  –––––––(2)–  ––––––––3––––––
    B –|–––––3–––  ––––––––2––  ––––––––3––  ––––––––3––––––
    G –|–––––2–––  ––––––––2––  ––––––––4––  ––––––––0––––––
    D –|––0––––––  ––––––––2––  ––––––––4––  ––––––––0––––––
    A –|–––––––––  –––––0–––––  ––0––2–––––  ––––––––x––––––
    E –|–––––––––  ––3––––––––  –––––––––––  ––2––3–––––––––
          D             A            Bm           G

## Chords needed for the song

Here's the normal way you play the chords used in this song:

    e –––2––––0––––3––––2––––
    B –––3––––2––––3––––3––––
    G –––2––––2––––0––––4––––
    D –––0––––2––––0––––4––––
    A ––––––––0––––2––––2––––
    E –––––––––––––3–––––––––
         D    A    G    Bm

But for the intro, I recommend the following voicings / finger positions:

    e ––––––––    x--- don't play this string
    B –––2––––    <--- left hand index finger (barred)
    G –––2––––    <--- left hand index finger (barred)
    D –––2––––    <--- left hand index finger (barred)
    A –––0––––
    E ––––––––
         A    

    e –––3––––    <--- left hand pinky finger
    B –––3––––    <--- left hand ring finger
    G –––0––––
    D –––0––––
    A –––x––––    x--- don't play this string (mute it)
    E –––3––––    <--- left hand middle finger
         G
