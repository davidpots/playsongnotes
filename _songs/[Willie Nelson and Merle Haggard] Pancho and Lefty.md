## Editor's notes

Another song I very recently fell deeply in love with for the first time. I first came across the Willie & Merle version (which I enjoyed), and then discovered Townes Van Zandt (who wrote this song) – who I embarrassingly didn't even know existed. I began devouring his music, and this song in particular. Aside from his finger style work, I wouldn't describe his guitar arrangements as flashy or readily distinct as Willie's -- which really allows for his lyrics to shine through in an unreal way. It was hearing his version of the song that really let the raw emotion and sentiment creep in. I couldn't get enough, and of course being in love with Willie's guitar style right now -- went to him and Merle's version so I could finally learn that very cool intro riff. One day I'll learn the solo, and do a lesson for it! But it will probably be a bit down the road. In the meantime, enjoy.

## Intro riff

### How Merle actually plays it

Not only is this the way Merle plays it, but it's also how I recommend learning it. This isn't trivially easy to play, but it's easier than the version further below AND it provides a consistent sound when played, which is a good thing. The great part about this approach is you're 100% on the highest 3 strings. True, you can let the D string ring on some / any / all of these chords (and it sounds great!) -- but because that D string is always left open (not fretted), it doesn't require any add'l left hand work to do this.

    E ––10––––9–––7–––9–––7–––5–5–––––––5–––––3–––2–––3–––2–––0–2––––––––
    B ––10––––10––8–––10––8–––5–7–––––––7–––––3–––3–––3–––3–––3–3––––––––
    G ––11––––9–––7–––9–––7–––7–7–––––––7–––––4–––2–––4–––2–––2–2––––––––
    D ––0–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––0––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    A –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
        1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

### First way I learned it

At first, I was convinced this was it -- and for sure, if you wanted to you could play it this way and be 100% fine. The downside of this version is about practicality -- in that, you're on the highest 3 strings for the first half, and then the 4th / 3rd / 2nd strings for the second half. One reason this is bad has to do with picking accuracy –– it's quite a bit harder to cleanly strum the 2nd/3rd/4th strings (only) in a way that matches the sound of the 1st half, where you're on the highest 3 strings. If you're curious, feel free to practice it this way! I enjoyed getting this under my belt. But again, after doing some digging and watching a video of Merle Haggard playing it –– I'm won over by the practicality of his version.

    E ––10––––9–––7–––9–––7––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

    D ––––––––––––––––––––––––9–12––––––12––––9–––7–––9–––7–––7–7––––––––
    A –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
        1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
