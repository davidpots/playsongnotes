<p>Hey friends! Hereâ€™s a guitar lesson showing you how to play the Maren Morris song â€œMy Churchâ€ from her 2016 album Hero. While big picture this might appear to be a straightforward song using only G-C-D, thereâ€™s actually a bit of nuance Iâ€™ll explain when it comes to things. For both the chord voicings and the strumming, Iâ€™ll show you two different ways to approach things, which lets you tailor your approach to suit your skill level &amp; preference.</p>

<p>Thanks to Patreon supporters Jim and Isa for recommending this one! This has been one of my favorite Maren Morris songs over the past couple years, and I had a good time learning it.</p>

<p>Thanks all, and have a great Sunday âœŒï¸</p>

<h2 id="capo-2nd-fret-to-play-with-marens-version">Capo 2nd fret to play with Marenâ€™s versionâ€¦</h2>

<p>Capo 2nd fret + standard tuning to play along with Maren Morrisâ€™ album version. Iâ€™ve also seen her play it capo 3rd fret while tuned down 1/2 step. You can also use no capo and be just fine, if you donâ€™t care about playing along with her recording.</p>

<h2 id="chord-shapes-needed">Chord shapes needed</h2>

<p>This entire song uses G / C / D7, with one very occasional E-minor used. If you want to sub a normal D-major chord instead of a D7, thatâ€™s totally fine. Hereâ€™s two ways to approach the chords, which keep the transitions as easy as possible.</p>

<h3 id="variation-1">Variation 1</h3>

<p>One way to keep the transition as easy as possible is to use the formations shown here. The important thing to note here is your left ring finger is on the 2nd string (B) for the G, Cadd9, and D chords â€“ making these transitions much simpler! Likewise, the G-Cadd9 transition is simplified because your left ring and pinky fingers are in the exact same spot for both chords (and, your left middle/index fingers stay in the same relative formation, being diagonal from each other).</p>

<p>Itâ€™s okay that weâ€™re using a Cadd9 in place of a regular C here â€“ in fact, it looks like this is what Maren Morris is playing (looking at the NPR Tiny Desk performance). You lose out on the D7 in this version, but you gain simplicity in other ways.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e â€“â€“3â€“â€“ &lt;= left pinky    â€“â€“3â€“â€“ &lt;= left pinky     â€“â€“2â€“â€“ &lt;= left middle   â€“â€“0â€“â€“
B â€“â€“3â€“â€“ &lt;= left ring     â€“â€“3â€“â€“ &lt;= left ring      â€“â€“3â€“â€“ &lt;= left ring     â€“â€“0â€“â€“
G â€“â€“0â€“â€“                  â€“â€“0â€“â€“                   â€“â€“2â€“â€“ &lt;= left index    â€“â€“0â€“â€“
D â€“â€“0â€“â€“                  â€“â€“2â€“â€“ &lt;= left index     â€“â€“0â€“â€“                  â€“â€“2â€“â€“ &lt;= left middle
A â€“â€“2â€“â€“ &lt;= left index    â€“â€“3â€“â€“ &lt;= left middle    â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“                  â€“â€“2â€“â€“ &lt;= left index
E â€“â€“3â€“â€“ &lt;= left middle   â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“                   â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“                  â€“â€“0â€“â€“
    G                    Cadd9                     D                      Em
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="variation-2">Variation 2</h3>

<p>This option takes a totally different approach to the G and C finger positions, where your left ring and left middle are on the thickest two strings. This variation also has your left index finger on the same note (1st fret of the B string) for the C and the D7 chords, making this transition easier.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="chord-progressions">Chord progressions</h2>

<p>Four counts per measure, and remember the counting is slow (77bpm, just over one count per second). The chord progression for each section is similarâ€¦ note how the first 4 measures of each section are the exact same. Itâ€™s in the final 4 measures (of the verse and chorus) where things deviate slightly.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming pattern</h2>

<h3 id="16th-note-primer">16th note primer</h3>

<p>First, get comfortable with the 16th note timing (at 77 BPM, which is slower than many songs). Each of the 4 beats is broken into 4 sub-beats (16th notes). Counted aloud, this sounds like â€œONE-eee-and-uhh TWO-eee-and-uhh,â€ and so on. Begin by trying a down strum on the quarter notes (1, 2, 3, and 4).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a
D       D       D       D
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="how-maren-strums-it">How Maren strums it</h3>

<p>For the actual song, I prefer to use this pattern, which is what Maren Morris plays on the album version. Arguably, the â€œeâ€ count immediately after the â€œ4â€ is omitted a lot of the time on the album, yet itâ€™s heard quite a bit too. I kept it in here to flesh things out at the end of the measure. Note, the â€œdâ€ means to do a softer down-strum (i.e., brush just some of the strings), while â€œDâ€ means to do an emphasized down-strums (all the strings, with oomph).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a
D       D     u D u D     u D u        "DOWN... DOWN, up-DOWN-up-DOWN... up-DOWN-up"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note, I find this pattern tough to do while singing! If you feel the same way, keep on reading â€“ Iâ€™ll show you an easier way just below.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-like-to-strum-it">How I like to strum it</h3>

<p>If the pattern above is too tricky for you, try this simpler variation â€“ which breaks things into two identical halves. Iâ€™ve added space before the â€œ3â€ count to help visualize where the pattern starts over again â€“ but note, you should still maintain a steady count with your rhythm for all beats. The main idea here is to really emphasize the â€œ2â€ and â€œ4â€ counts â€“ all other strums can be light brushes on the strings.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 e + a 2 e + a    3 e + a 4 e + a
d   d   D   d u    d   d   D   d u      "down down DOWN down-up, down down DOWN down-up"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You know how I said you can do light brushes on all strums except the 2 and 4 count? Hereâ€™s what I mean. On the first two down strums, weâ€™re going to focus on the thickest 1-2 strings of the chord being played. On the â€œ2â€ count, weâ€™ll strum all the strings â€“ and add emphasis. And on the final â€œ+ aâ€ count, just brush the thinnest 1-2 strings. Repeat this for the second half of the measure. Hereâ€™s an example tab for the main three chords â€“ play each sequence below TWICE to make up a full measure of 4 counts per that chord.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“3â€“3â€“â€“â€“      e â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“0â€“0â€“â€“â€“      e â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“2â€“2â€“â€“â€“

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="progression-with-strumming">Progression with strumming</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s a helpful guide to practice the strum pattern Maren Morris uses within context of the actual chords. The one new thing here: notice when a chord change happens on the â€œ3â€ count (e.g., in the 2nd measure), she actually switches on the â€œaâ€ count just before the â€œ3â€ (i.e., a sixteenth note early). This may seem tricky but it actually works great work this strumming pattern, since youâ€™re starting an up-down-up-down on that same count.</p>
