<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor‚Äôs notes</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs a country-inspired arrangement of Green Day‚Äôs ‚ÄúWelcome to Paradise‚Äù from their 1994 album Dookie. This one is arranged in the style of Tyler Childers, who is maybe my favorite country artist of the late 2010s. Similar to other songs Childers plays, I‚Äôm doing this one in the key of D (you can do drop-D as well), and adding some country inspired licks to fully pain the picture.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs audio of me playing it:</p>

<p>Again, note this is all one whole-step lower than one Green Day plays. I‚Äôm playing it in this key because it fits the country arrangement I‚Äôm doing better. See my video for more context here.</p>
