<h2 id="guitar-lesson">Guitar lesson</h2>

<p>I haven’t made one yet – but please <a href="mailto:play.songnotes@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a> if this is a song you’d like to learn! This will help me bump it closer to the top of the list.</p>

<h2 id="ukulele-mini-lesson">Ukulele mini-lesson</h2>

<p>Here’s a video showing how to play the chorus of this song on the ukulele. Note, this was the first video lesson I made after a 2-3 year break… so it’s not up to my usual standard with regard to production &amp; presentation.</p>

<h2>No PDF chord sheet exists for this lesson</h2>

<p>As of now, I haven't made a printable PDF to accompany this video lesson. If you'd like to request that I make one, <a href="mailto:play.songnotes@gmail.com?subject=PDF Request for 'The Man Who Sold the World (ukulele)'">shoot me an email</a>. I can't guarantee I'll make a PDF for every older lesson, but it's helpful to know which lessons have the most interest.</p>
