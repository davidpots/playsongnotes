<p>Hey there friends! I want to share a brand new &amp; updated PDF I made for Paul Simonâ€™s Kodachrome â€“â€“ and while Iâ€™m at it dive a bit deeper into some other gems when it comes to his guitar playing. This includes my earlier lesson for Mrs. Robinson, as well as a brief look at Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard. I have PDFs for all of these available via the button just above â€“ and in my video Iâ€™ll give an overview of each of the print-friendly PDFs Iâ€™ve created for these songs.</p>

<p>This is a song I donâ€™t have a lesson for as of now, but my text-only draft PDF (that I show in the video above) <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/49439026">is available here</a> to Patreon supporters. Look for a lesson coming on that eventually!</p>

<p>This is likewise a song I havenâ€™t learned yet, but due to a huge nunmber of requests Iâ€™ve started to learn. Look for a lesson coming very soon (subscribe on YouTube to stay in the loop).</p>
