<p>Hey friends! Today weâ€™re looking at â€œKeep â€˜Em on They Toesâ€ by Brent Cobb, one of my absolute favorite new songs from 2020. If you havenâ€™t heard this one, give it a listen â€“ the combination of the witty lyrics, Cobbâ€™s vocal style, and easy-going (yet nuanced) guitar part make it a blast to play. While normally played in the key of E (no capo, E - B7 - C#m - A), Iâ€™ll be focusing on a key of C version (capo 4, C - G - Am - F)â€¦ which enables you to play the distinctive flourish notes while strumming.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s timestamps for my video lesson:</p>

<p>If you havenâ€™t heard this song before, give it a quick listen â€“ Iâ€™m confident the opening verse will get its hooks in.</p>

<h2 id="capo-4-key-of-c-or-no-capo-key-of-e">Capo 4 (key of C) or no capo (key of E)?</h2>

<p>From watching a solo acoustic live video, Brent Cobb plays this song in the key of E, without a capo (using the chords E / B7 / C#m / A). However, I like playing it capo 4 â€“ which lets you use key of C chords (C / G / Am/ F), and more importantly lets you play those flourish notes you hear in Cobbâ€™s album version. Itâ€™s up to you how to approach itâ€¦ but Iâ€™m teaching it capo 4 because thatâ€™s how I like to play it.</p>

<h2 id="chord-shapes">Chord shapes</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s how to play the chords, for both the capo 4 version as well as the no capo version. For the F chord, you donâ€™t need to do a full 6-string Fâ€¦ I often play just the middle four strings (for the chorus), or the thinnest four strings (for the verse).</p>

<h2 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming pattern</h2>

<p>A few options hereâ€¦ I think the main idea is to keep it a bit chill, casual, and low-key. Hereâ€™s two patterns: the first of which I use during the verse &amp; the end of the chorus, while the other (a bit more bouncy) I use during the up-beat part of the chorus.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>See PDF for strumming diagrams.
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="adding-the-flourish-notes-during-the-verse">Adding the flourish notes during the verse</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s some tabs to help you play the distinctive flourish notes you hear during the verse. Two big ideas to keep in mind here. (1) These notes happen every OTHER measure, meaning after you play them â€“ you return to a measure of normal strumming. In my chart, I use an asterisk to denote a measure played with flourish. (2) You can actually keep your D-DU-UDU strum going through both these measuresâ€¦ and play the flourish notes on the â€œUâ€ up-strum notes of that pattern. Just make sure you keep the strum low-key &amp; chill, only playing some of the strings (donâ€™t overdo it). See my video lesson for reference.</p>
