<p>As I note at the start of this video, thanks to all of you who are (and who have in the past) supported me on Patreon. I’ve just hit the 3000 subscriber milestone, which is something I owe entirely to all of you in my audience. The lessons will keep on coming, that’s for sure – I hope they continue to be helpful going forward.</p>
