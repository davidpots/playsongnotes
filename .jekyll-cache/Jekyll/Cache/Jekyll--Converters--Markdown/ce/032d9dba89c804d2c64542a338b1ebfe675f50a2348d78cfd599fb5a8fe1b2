<h2 id="editors-notes">Editorâ€™s notes</h2>

<p>Recently Iâ€™ve been learning a song that features heavy use of walk ups &amp; walk downs on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings â€“ so I went ahead and created this exercise to give me some practice reps. Weâ€™ll be in the key of G, using the chords of G C and D, and starting with a simple alternating-bass-note strum. From there, weâ€™ll add some connective phrases to help us switch between chords. This breaks up the strumming, adding a bit of melodic shape to the playing. In the lesson Iâ€™ll explain the chords, the strumming, how to approach the connective phrases, and give general tips for learning this style of guitar.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a related lesson I did doing this same technique using the chords of E, A, and B7. The biggest difference in this lesson below is Iâ€™m doing the walk-ups and walk-downs on the 6th and 5th strings, which I think is a bit easier to play (compared to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings).</p>

<p>Likewise, hereâ€™s a lesson I made showing this same technique using the chords of A, D, and E. The PDF for this lesson <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/24901786">is available here</a>.</p>
