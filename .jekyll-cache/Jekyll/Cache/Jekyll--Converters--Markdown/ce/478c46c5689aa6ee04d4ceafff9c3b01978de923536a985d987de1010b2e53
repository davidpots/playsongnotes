<h2 id="capo-5th-fret">Capo 5th Fret</h2>

<p>To play this song on guitar (and be in the same key as the Iz version, so that you can play along) you‚Äôll need a capo on the 5th fret while using the chords above. If you don‚Äôt have a capo, you can still use the chords above and play the song ‚Äì though you couldn‚Äôt properly play along with the album version since you‚Äôd be in a different key.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-play-the-guitar-chords">How to play the guitar chords</h2>

<p>Here is how you play the guitar chords used in this song. It is worth noting that this song is originally performed on a ukulele, which only has four strings. As appropriate, I‚Äôm taking the same chords used on the ukulele and showing how to play them on the guitar.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e-|---3---0---2---0----0----0----2---
B-|---0---1---3---0----3----1----0---
G-|---0---0---2---0----0----2----2---
D-|---0---2---0---2----2----2----1---
A-|---2---3-------2----2----0----2---
E-|---3-----------0----0-------------
      G   C   D   Em  Em7   Am   B7
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to get a bit more in depth with the guitar chords, I should note a few optional variations you can include as you see fit. In the verses, most of the D-chords would more properly be a Bm7 or the D/F# variation. Note that in the refrain sections, the D-chords return to the typical ‚Äúnormal‚Äù D chord I show above. Above all, it is up to you to play what you desire and see fit ‚Äì I just wanted to make this note for the sake of being complete.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e-|-----2------2-----
B-|-----3------3-----
G-|-----2------2-----
D-|-----4------4-----
A-|------------2-----

<h2 id="chord-progressions">Chord progressions</h2>

<p>If we ignore the lyrics for a moment, here‚Äôs a look at the chord progressions for the entire song. I‚Äôve mapped these out measure by measure, so you can get a big picture view on how the timing works. Personally, this always helps me memorize things quite a bit more quickly.</p>
