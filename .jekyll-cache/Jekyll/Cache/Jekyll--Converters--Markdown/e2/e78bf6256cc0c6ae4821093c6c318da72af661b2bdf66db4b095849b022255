<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>In this lesson I’ll show you one of my go-to warmup exercises from the past few years, which involves playing the E-major with the thinnest four strings – and adding flourish with your left pinky and ring finger. This takes an otherwise familiar &amp; common chord, and mixes it up a bit: you’re getting a slight less full sound (from only playing 4 strings), but you benefit from having a few extra fingers to add meldoic flourish notes with. I’ll show it all to you: the chord shapes, the riff, the strumming, including in tab. I hope you enjoy.</p>

<p>I should note, this is based on the background lead guitar part Father John Misty song “I’m Writing a Novel” – which is track 4 from his great album “Fear Fun”. The riff first comes in after he finishes the first verse – it’s subtle, but it’s there.</p>
