<p>As of now, I haven't made a printable PDF to accompany this video lesson. If you'd like to request that I make one, <a href="mailto:play.songnotes@gmail.com?subject=PDF Request for 'All These Years'">shoot me an email</a>. I can't guarantee I'll make a PDF for every older lesson, but it's helpful to know which lessons have the most interest.</p>
