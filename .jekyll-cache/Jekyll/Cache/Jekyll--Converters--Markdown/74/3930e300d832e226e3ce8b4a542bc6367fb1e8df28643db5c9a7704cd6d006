<p>Hey friends! Hereâ€™s a lesson explaining G-chord finger positioning, and how to approach the different finger placement options you have while playing that chord (e.g., ring finger vs. middle finger on the low E-string). To get right to the point: itâ€™s all about the <em>other</em> chords youâ€™re playing, which have finger-placement requirements of their own. In my lesson Iâ€™ll show which chords work best with one version of G, and which work with the other version of G. If youâ€™ve ever had a tricky time switching to or from the G-chord, this video is for you.</p>

<p>For example, youâ€™ll want to use your middle finger on the low-E string if youâ€™re also playing these chords:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cadd9 (which can be used for a C)</li>
  <li>D</li>
  <li>D/F#</li>
  <li>Em or Em7</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, youâ€™ll want to use your ring finger on the low-E string if youâ€™re also playing these chords:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>F or Fadd9</li>
  <li>Am or Am7</li>
  <li>D7</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out my video, and Iâ€™ll explain all this with close ups of my hand to show you why all this matters. Thanks and enjoy!</p>
