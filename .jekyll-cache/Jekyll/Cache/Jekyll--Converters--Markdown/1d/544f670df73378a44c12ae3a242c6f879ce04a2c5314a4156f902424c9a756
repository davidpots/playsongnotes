VERSE
    C                      Em
    ...She may contain the urge to run away
                 Am
    But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
    C                     Em
    ...Cetirizine, your fever's gripped me again
          Am
    Never kisses, all you ever send are fullstops (la la la la!)

    C              Em
    ...Do you know where the wilds things go
         Am
    They go along to take your honey (la la la la!)
    C                                   Em
    ...Break down, now weep... build up breakfast now let's eat
                Am
    My love, my love... love... love... (la la la la!)

CHORUS
        F                        C
        ...Muscle to muscle, and toe to toe
        Em                             Am           G/B
        ...The fear has gripped me but... here I go
        F                    C
        ...My heart sinks as I jump up
        Em                          Am      G/B
        ...Your hand grips hand, as my eyes shut

        C     Em    Am       C  
        Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ah ahh...
        C     Em    Am       C (let ring)
        Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ah ahh, ahh

    Do you know where the wilds things go
    They go along to take your honey (la la la la!)
    Break down, now sleep... build up breakfast now let's eat
    My love, my love... love... love... (la la la la!)

    She bruises coughs, she splutters pistol shots
    But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks (la la la la!)
    She's morphine, queen of my vaccine
    My love, my love... love... love... (la la la la!)

        Muscle to muscle, and toe to toe
        The fear has gripped me but... here I go
        My heart sinks as I jump up
        Your hand grips hand, as my eyes shut

        Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ah ahh...
        Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ah ahh...

        Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ah ahh...
        Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ah ahh, ahh

    (quieter)
    She may contain the urge to run away
    But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
    Germolene, disinfect the scene
    My love, my love... love... love...

BRIDGE
            (let chords ring)
            Dm               C                   Am
            Please don't go... I love you so, my lovely

            (on Am, begin this instrumental break)

            Am ... C ... C ... F . C . x1

            Am
            Please don't go, please don't go
              C                               F  C
            I love you so, I love you so----

            Please don't go, please don't go
            I love you so, I love you so (please break my heart)

            Please don't go, please don't go
            I love you so, I love you so----

            Please don't go, please don't go

OUTRO

                ...I love you so... I love you so, I love you so

<h2 id="notes-and-tabs">Notes and tabs</h2>

<h3 id="capo-5th-fret-standard-tuning">Capo 5th Fret, Standard Tuning</h3>
<p>The chords I show here are for playing this song in standard tuning, with a capo on the 5th fret. This will let you play along with the album version, if should so choose. Note, there are other lessons online for playing this song in double-drop-D tuning. If you’re interested in that approach, look elsewhere – I believe this is how alt-J plays it, but I’m more concerned with covering a basic / beginner approach (which I show here).</p>

<h3 id="guitar-chords-used">Guitar Chords Used</h3>
<p>Here’s how to play the guitar chords used in this song. I’m focused on the open-position basic version of these chords. If you want to get more advanced, go for it – but these work just fine.</p>
