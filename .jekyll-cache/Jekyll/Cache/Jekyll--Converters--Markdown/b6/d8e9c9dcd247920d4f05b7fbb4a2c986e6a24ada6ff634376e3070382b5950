<p>In this lesson I’ll show you how to play an acoustic fingerstyle intro to “You’ve Got a Friend in Me”, the classic song from the Toy Story movies. This particular arrangement is taken from the YouTube cover of this song by Claire Ryann and her dad, who plays this beautifully and makes it look easy. It’s only 4 measures, but I’ll break it down for you step by step: the left hand chord shapes, the right hand fingerstyle technique, and also show some opportunities to add some advanced rhythm flourish.</p>
