<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends, here’s a quick percussive technique video showing you how to silence the strings with you picking (right) hand – which in this lesson, uses two 1960s riffs where we’ll be silencing things specifically on the 2-count. Aside from being a helpful technique for you to be familiar with, it’s also neat to hear the similarities of this trick as used in these songs I’ll show you – being “My Girl” (The Temptations, 1964) and “Stand By Me” (Ben E. King, 1961). Note, I do have a full video lesson for “Stand By Me” if you want to learn that song… check out lesson #308 on my website.</p>

<h3 id="silencing-strings-with-your-fretting-hand-311">Silencing strings with your fretting hand (#311)</h3>

<p>A very different way to accomplish a very similar outcome is to silence strings with your left hand (by loosening your fingers from the fretboard, but keeping them on the strings). I show you that in detail in this lesson (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/39450599">here’s the PDF for that lesson</a>):</p>

<h3 id="slap-strum-technique-197">Slap-strum technique (#197)</h3>

<p>You might also like this lesson, which shows you how to use your strumming (left) hand to add a percussive “hit” on the string as part of the strumming motion. This also is an effective way to silence the strings, but notably does so immediately after a chord is played – which adds some distinction to this sound (<a href="PDF available here">https://www.patreon.com/posts/23199900</a>).</p>

<h3 id="palm-muting-basics-187">Palm muting basics (#187)</h3>

<p>We also have palm muting, which is related to all of this. Here, we’ll be resting our right (strumming/picking) hand on the very bottom part of strings – where they connect to the pegs – as we play them. This lets the notes continue to ring out, but they’re “muted” and muffled, in a way that can be advantageous. <a href="PDF available at this link">https://www.patreon.com/posts/22409071</a>, video below:</p>
