<h2 id="how-to-play-b-minor-chord-on-guitar">How to play B-minor chord on guitar</h2>

<p>In this quick practice tip, I’ll show you how to play the dreaded B minor chord. B minor is one of the first barre chords you’ll run into – which can be difficult to learn. I’ll walk you through it step by step, showing you how to play it with and without barring your index finger. This is a fantastic “first” barre chord to learn, as it is far easier than playing F. Best of all, learning B minor will help you build the finger muscles you’ll need to finally learn F too :)</p>

<p>Here’s the quick diagram, with finger positions noted. See my video for more detail!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E –––2–––  &lt;-- left index finger (barred)
B –––3–––  &lt;-- left middle finger
G –––4–––  &lt;-- left pinky finger
D –––4–––  &lt;-- left ring finger
A –––2–––  &lt;-- left index finger (barred)
E –––––––
     Bm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>NOTE: From 1:25 to 2:23, I forgot to update the chord graphic I have on the screen. This is the part where I talk about putting your index finger down to barre the 2nd fret. If you’re viewing on a large screen (desktop or laptop), you’ll see the YouTube annotations I added to semi-correct this. On mobile, though, you won’t see this – so just be aware. I do show the proper chart at the beginning and end of the video (x24432).</p>
