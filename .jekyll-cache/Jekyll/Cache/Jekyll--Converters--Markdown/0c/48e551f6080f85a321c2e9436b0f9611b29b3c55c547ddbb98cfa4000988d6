<p>In this lesson, Iâ€™ll show you an approachable 3-string exercise you can use to beef up your ring finger barre chord strength. This is a barring technique youâ€™ll need when playing the A-shape barre chord (e.g., x1333x or x3555x) - which can be tough to master! But that doesnâ€™t mean it needs to be difficult to learn. With this exercise, youâ€™ll be able to have fun with 3 related chords (I-IV-V triads) while focusing on just three strings. This lets you noodle around freely, perhaps work on some picking or strumming exercises, all the while youâ€™re building up your ring finger strength. I hope you enjoy!</p>
