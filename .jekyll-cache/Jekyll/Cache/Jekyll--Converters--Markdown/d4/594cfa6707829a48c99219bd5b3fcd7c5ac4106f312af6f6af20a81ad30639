<h2 id="song-lyrics">Song lyrics</h2>

<p>Youâ€™ve got a friend in me
Youâ€™ve got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And youâ€™re miles and miles
From your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
Boy, youâ€™ve got a friend in me
Yeah, youâ€™ve got a friend in me</p>

<p>Youâ€™ve got a friend in me
Youâ€™ve got a friend in me
If youâ€™ve got troubles
Iâ€™ve got â€˜em too
There isnâ€™t anything, I wouldnâ€™t do for you
We stick together and can see it through
â€˜Cause youâ€™ve got a friend in me
Youâ€™ve got a friend in me</p>

<p>Some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you
The way I do, itâ€™s me and you
Boy, and as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
Youâ€™re gonna see itâ€™s our destiny
Youâ€™ve got a friend in me
Youâ€™ve got a friend in me
Youâ€™ve got a friend in me</p>
