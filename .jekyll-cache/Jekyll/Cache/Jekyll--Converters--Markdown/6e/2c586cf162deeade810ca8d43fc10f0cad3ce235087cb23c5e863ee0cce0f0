<p>I have not yet made a PDF version of this lesson. If you'd like to request that I make one, <a href="mailto:play.songnotes@gmail.com?subject=PDF Request for ''">shoot me an email</a> and please let me know - I am always adding back catalog lessons to my PDF library.</p>

<p>Hey friends! Here’s 4 new PDF chord sheets for you, giving you the print-friendly goods for 4 different songs I learned on a family road trip earlier this summer. Instead of waiting until I got lessons made for each of these, I wanted to get these to you ASAP so you can have at ‘em in the meantime. The four songs in question:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Saskatchewan in 1881 by Colter Wall (simplified strum version)</li>
  <li>Manhattan Island Serenade by Vincent Neil Emerson</li>
  <li>Betty by Taylor Swift</li>
  <li>Welcome to Paradise by Green Day (in the style of Tyler Childers)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="want-lessons-for-these-let-me-know-which-ones">Want lessons for these? Let me know which ones!</h2>

<p>I plan on making lessons for each of these eventually – but would love feedback you have on which songs you’d like to see lessons for first. That’ll help me prioritize things. <a href="mailto:play.songnotes@gmail.com">Email me</a> and let me know.</p>

<p>Here’s Green Day’s version… obviously, the version I put together sounds very different as it’s acoustic and uses country-inspired riffs.</p>
