<h2>No PDF chord sheet exists for this lesson</h2>

<p>As of now, I haven't made a printable PDF to accompany this video lesson. If you'd like to request that I make one, <a href="mailto:play.songnotes@gmail.com?subject=PDF Request for '2U'">shoot me an email</a>. I can't guarantee I'll make a PDF for every older lesson, but it's helpful to know which lessons have the most interest.</p>
<p class="small"><em><a href="http://playsongnotes.com/downloads">Here's a list</a> of the 200+ lessons I have made PDFs for.</em></p>

<h2 id="capo-4th-fret">Capo 4th fret</h2>

<p>This is so you can use open standard chord shapes, and not be stuck in barre chord hell.</p>

<h2 id="chords-needed">Chords needed</h2>

<p>For the most part, you can use these three chords to play most of the song. Note, the E-minor voicing here is intentionally using only four of the 6 strings. See my video lesson for context here.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E |â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“
B |â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“1â€“â€“â€“
G |â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“
D |â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“
A |â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“
E |â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
      Em   D    C   
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Youâ€™ll also need these chords for other parts of the song:</p>
