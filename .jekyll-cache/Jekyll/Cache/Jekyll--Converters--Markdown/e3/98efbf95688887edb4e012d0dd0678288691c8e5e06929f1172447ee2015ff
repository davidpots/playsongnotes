<h2 id="editors-notes">Editorâ€™s notes</h2>

<p>In this lesson, Iâ€™ll describe some of the very repetitive (but fun!) exercises I found myself settling into while recently learning â€œThe Windâ€ by Cat Stevens. Instead of shying away from â€œplaying the same thing over and over,â€ I often embrace it â€“Â and use such occasions to intently focus on some of the more subtle aspects of playing: playing at a consistent volume, avoiding string buzz, striving for steady bass note volume, and so forth. Iâ€™ll show examples of all this, with a few sequences to practice for yourself if youâ€™d like to come along for the journey.</p>

<p>If you would like to view my full lesson for â€œThe Windâ€ by Cat Stevens, you can find it here:

<p>Thanks and enjoy!</p>
