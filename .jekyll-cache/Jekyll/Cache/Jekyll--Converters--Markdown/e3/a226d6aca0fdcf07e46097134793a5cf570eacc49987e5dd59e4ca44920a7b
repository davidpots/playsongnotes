<p>Hey friends! In this lesson I‚Äôll teach you how to play the fingerstyle introduction to ‚ÄúMy Old Kentucky Home, Goodnight‚Äù as covered by John Prine. I‚Äôll teach you the three chords (including the variations needed for each), explain the alternating bass notes your right thumb will need to play, talk about the hammer-ons you‚Äôll add, and break down the fingerstyle one phrase at a time. This one took me a few weeks to get comfortable with, but patience and practice paid off ‚Äì and I‚Äôm excited to share these notes with you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>0:00 Playthrough &amp; lesson overview</li>
  <li>1:34 Chord shapes needed</li>
  <li>7:08 Right thumb alternating bass notes</li>
  <li>9:18 Adding left-hand hammer-ons</li>
  <li>12:10 Tip: break it into phrases!</li>
  <li>13:58 Melody, part 1 &amp; 2</li>
  <li>19:12 Melody, parts 3 &amp; 4</li>
  <li>21:50 Farewell</li>
</ul>

<p>If you‚Äôd like to see a lesson for the full song, please let me know ‚Äì¬†I‚Äôd like to get to it one day. Thanks and best of luck! - David Pots (May 16, 2019)</p>
