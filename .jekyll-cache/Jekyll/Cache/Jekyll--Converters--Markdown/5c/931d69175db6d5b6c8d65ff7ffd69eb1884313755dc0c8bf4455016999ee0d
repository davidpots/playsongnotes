<p>In this lesson I‚Äôll show &amp; explain how to play ‚ÄúThe Wind‚Äù by Cat Stevens, from his 1971 album Teaser and the Firecat. This is a short but fantastic Cat Stevens song, combining fingerstyle verses with strummed chorus. I‚Äôll explain the chords, talk through the fingerpicking (main riff included), and break down the verse and chorus sections. I hope you enjoy!</p>
