<p>Hey friends! Here’s a tip &amp; technique video, with a companion PDF chord sheet, showing you how to approach the F-major chord with a wrapped thumb on the low E string. Specifically, I’ll be talking about how this technique is helpful when playing fingerstyle - when you’ll often want your left pinky free to add flourish notes on the thinnest couple strings. I’ll walk you through the technique, starting simple and guiding you through the process. I’ll even show you a few practice exercises to put this technique through the paces. I hope you enjoy!</p>
