<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor‚Äôs notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends! Here‚Äôs a quick little warm-up exercise I want to share, based on the intro riff to ‚ÄúStarlight‚Äù by Logan Ledger (2020). This riff takes just a minute to learn, being based on two relatively basic triad chord shapes (F#, and A-major with a flat-5th). The real magic here comes through the subtle use of dissonance within both of the chord shapes: while this may seem slightly harsh to the ear, we‚Äôll be using it sparingly via the picking pattern I‚Äôll show you. The result is a 4-measure riff that makes for some good practice, whether you‚Äôre playing fingerstyle or with a pick.</p>

<p>This riff comes from the opening sequence to ‚ÄúStarlight‚Äù by Logan Ledger, which is the second track from his self-titled 2020 album. Listen here to hear the riff in context:</p>
