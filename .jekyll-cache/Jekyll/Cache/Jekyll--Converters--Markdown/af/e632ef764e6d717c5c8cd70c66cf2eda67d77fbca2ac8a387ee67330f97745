<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends! I recently needed to restring my guitar — and thought it may be helpful to record the entire process, from beginning to end. To be clear, I don’t pretend to be an expert when it comes to changing strings or guitar maintenance. Likewise, this isn’t a “tutorial” per se. Instead, it’s meant to be an honest depiction of what the process looks like for me. Unlike other videos I’ve made, this one is done in a single unedited take – to help portray how long this really takes.</p>

<p>Here’s the timestamps for this video:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0:00 Overview</li>
  <li>1:36 Getting Comfortable</li>
  <li>3:01  Supplies &amp; new strings I’m using</li>
  <li>7:30 Removing old strings &amp; pegs</li>
  <li>13:44 Cleaning the guitar</li>
  <li>17:16 Putting on the new strings</li>
  <li>40:50 Tuning the new strings, 1st time</li>
  <li>45:34 Tuning the new strings, 2nd time</li>
  <li>47:12 Tuning the new strings, 3rd time</li>
  <li>50:17 Wrapping up &amp; farewell</li>
</ul>

<p>My request: if you are any kind of expert when it comes to restringing or guitar maintenance, feel free to send any feedback you have! I’m always looking to learn and improve. Thanks!</p>
