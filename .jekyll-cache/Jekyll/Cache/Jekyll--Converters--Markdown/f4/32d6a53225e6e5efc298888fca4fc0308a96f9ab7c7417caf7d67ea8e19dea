<p>In this lesson Iâ€™m happy to show you an easier way to play the F#m (F sharp minor) chord without using any barre chord techniques. I stumbled upon this voicing while recently learning â€œYesterdayâ€ by the Beatles, which features a tricky transition from G to F#m to B7 â€“Â and was happy to realize this simplified voicing worked great in that context. Note, what Iâ€™ll show is primarily meant for playing fingerstyle (it doesnâ€™t work as well with full strums). Iâ€™ll also show a few practice exercises you can use in order to get up to speed with using this simplified voicing in actual context. Finally, Iâ€™ll demonstrate how you can use this chord shape to play other minor chords up the fretboard (e.g., 5xx555 = A minor; 8xx888 = C minor; etc). Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoy!</p>
