<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends - here’s a guitar melody exercise, using the 1961 Elvis classic Can’t Help Falling in Love. Specifically, I’ll go measure-by-measure through the verse, and for each chord I’ll figure out what exact melody note Elvis is singing. This is an incredibly helpful skill to have. My hope is, by seeing me go through this in real time, you’ll glean a hint into the process of determining melody notes. In addition to my video, I’ve created 1-page PDF showing you the 16 measures of the verse, with the melody notes highlighted for you to play.</p>
