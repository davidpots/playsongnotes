<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>In this lesson I’ll show you a fun fingerstyle exercise based on a C-major walkdown progression. Using 2 different arrangements, I’ll teach how you can use common chords in the key of C to capture the sound of a descending bass line throughout an 8-measure progression. This is inspired by the guitar work heard in Taylor Swift’s song “Death by 1000 Cuts” – though you’ll need a capo 4th fret to play along with her song (using the tabs I show).</p>

<p>“Death by Thousand Cuts” by Taylor Swift. Again, you’ll need to add a capo on the 4th fret to play along with her version. The guitar starts 11 seconds in.</p>
