<p>Hey friends! Quick lesson here showing you 3 different ways to silence the strings using your fretting (left) hand. This is an valuable technique to use in various circumstances, as sometimes you‚Äôll want to stop/silence/punctuate/mute the ringing strings for percussive reasons ‚Äì and based on context of what you‚Äôre playing, there‚Äôs a few different approaches you‚Äôll need to take. I‚Äôll show you 3 such examples (with close-up photos of my hand) on how to do this, and follow them up with a specific song-based exercise (with tabs) to help you practice. Enjoy!</p>
