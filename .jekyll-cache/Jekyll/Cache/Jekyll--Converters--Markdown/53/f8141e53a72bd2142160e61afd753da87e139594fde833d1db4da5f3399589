<h2 id="editors-notes">Editorâ€™s notes</h2>

<p>In this lesson, Iâ€™ll teach you how to play â€œHigh and Dryâ€ by Radiohead, complete with chords and intro tabs. This song is from the 1995 album â€œThe Bends,â€ which personally is my favorite Radiohead album. Iâ€™ll show you two different ways to play the intro riff â€“ one on the higher frets (thicker strings), and another on the lower frets (thinner strings). Iâ€™m not sure which is the way Radiohead actually plays it â€“ but to my ear, they both sound valid. Otherwise, the song uses only 3 chords in a single progression that repeats for the entire song.  I hope you enjoy!</p>

VERSE

    F#m
    Two jumps in a week I bet you
    A                                E
    Think you're pretty clever, don't you boy
    F#m
    Flying on your motorcycle
    A                              E
    Watching all the ground beneath you drop

    You'd kill yourself for recognition
    Kill yourself to never, ever stop
    You broke another mirror
    You're turning into something you're not

CHORUS
                       F#m    A                   E
        Don't leave me high....... Don't leave me dry
                       F#m    A                   E
        Don't leave me high....... Don't leave me dry

    Drying up in conversation
    You'll be the one who cannot talk
    All your insides fall to pieces
    You just sit there wishing you could still make love

    They're the ones who'll hate you when you
    Think you've got the world all sussed out
    They're the ones who'll spit at you
    You'll be the one screaming out

        [ chorus ]

    (instrumental verse with solo)

    It's the best thing that you've ever had
    The best thing that you've ever, ever had
    It's the best thing that you've ever had
    The best thing you have had has gone away

        [ chorus x2 ]

<p>The first variation uses these three positions:</p>
