<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>In this lesson I’ll show you two different fingerstyle arrangements I put together using the chords C-G-Am-F, both of which are inspired by the Vampire Weekend song “Hold You Now”. Normally, when a song gets in my head I’ll casually strum it when playing guitar – but for this song, I found myself gravitating toward the Travis picking fingerstyle. This was a first for me, so I wanted to capture it in my practice log and share these two exercises. They both use the same chord progression and bass notes, but it’s the right-index-finger melody notes that are slightly different between the two exercises. I’ll talk you through some of my process, and of course show you the tabs. I hope you enjoy!</p>
