<p>I haven’t made one yet – but here’s a preview of the PDF I made for this song. Note, my PDF is for a strummed verison of this song – i.e., it gives you all the chords you need to play along with Colter. It doesn’t have the fingerstyle tabs, as I haven’t worked that out yet. I’d suggest <a href="http://www.banthamlegend.com/Saskatchewan-in-1881/">this lesson</a> if you want to learn it fingerstyle, like Colter plays it.</p>

<p>Note, this is from a “strummed” version of the song – so far I haven’t mastered Colter’s fingerstyle, so the strum version will have to do.</p>
