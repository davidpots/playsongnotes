INTRO
    G ..... Bm .........  x4, with guitar riff

VERSE
    A                   C#m       F#m
    ...I hear the drums echoing tonight
    F#m/E          G                Bm           F#m   G     Bm
    She hears only whispers of some quiet conversa-----tion

    A               C#m               F#m
    ...She's coming in, twelve thirty flight
        F#m/E           G                    Bm                  F#m   G    Bm
    The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salva----tion

    A               C#m               F#m
    ...I stopped an old man along the way
    F#m/E               G             Bm               F#m      G     Bm
    Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient mel-----odies

    A               C#m         F#m
    ...He turned to me as if to say
     F#m/E           G                          Bm
    "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you..."

CHORUS
        Em                   C               G        D
        ...It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
        Em                        C              G               D
        ...There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
        Em             C             G   D
        ...I bless the rains down in Africa
        Em                 C              G
        ...Gonna take some time to do the things we never

    A                C#m            F#m
    ...The wild dogs cry out in the night
       F#m/E              G                Bm       F#m      G   Bm
    As they grow restless longing for some solitary co----mpany

    A              C#m              F#m
    ...I know that I must do what's right
               F#m/E       G           Bm               F#m        G   Bm
    As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Ser----engeti

    A            C#m                F#m
    ...I seek to cure what's deep inside...
       F#m/E              G                       Bm
    ...Frightened of this thing that I've become

        Em                   C               G        D
        ...It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you

<h2 id="capo-2nd-fret-standard-tuning">Capo 2nd fret, standard tuning</h2>
<p>This transcription assumes youâ€™re using a capo on the 2nd fret and in standard tuning. This allows you to play along with the Toto version heard on the record. As always â€“ you donâ€™t need a capo at all â€“ it merely lets you use these comfortable chords and be in the same key as the original artist. Feel free to use no capo, or apply the capo to whichever fret you like (to suit your voice) otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="guitar-chords">Guitar chords</h2>

<p>Here is how you play the guitar chords used in this song.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e-|---0-----4-----2------2-----3-----2-----0----0----2----
B-|---2-----5-----2------2-----0-----3-----0----1----3----
G-|---2-----6-----2------2-----0-----4-----0----0----2----
D-|---2-----6-----4------4-----0-----4-----2----2----0----
A-|---0-----4-----4------4-----2-----2-----2----3---------
E-|---------------2------0-----3-----------0--------------
      A    C#m   F#m   F#m/E   G     Bm    Em   C    D
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="guitar-intro-tab">Guitar intro tab</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s a few ways you can play the distinctive intro to this song on the guitar. This first way transitions from a standard open G-chord position into the B minor. As you practice this, try to minimize the movement of your index finger on the fretboard â€“ the transition from the F# bass note to the Bm-chord should ideally be as smooth as possible. As always, listen along for the exact rhythm.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e-|-------------------------------2----2----2----2---|-
B-|-------------------------------3----3----3----3---|-
G-|-------------------------------4----4----4----4---|-
D-|---0----------------------x----4----4----4----4---|-  ...repeat
A-|---2----------------------x----2----2----2----2---|-
E-|---3-----3--3-----3--3----2-----------------------|-
      G                           Bm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can position your left hand in a power chord shape for the G and F# chords, which makes the initial transition a bit easier. You do lose a bit of the G-major tonality though, since youâ€™re not playing the 3rd tone of the G major chord. Still, this is a perfect valid way to play this section.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e-|----------------------------------2----2----2----2---|-
B-|----------------------------------3----3----3----3---|-
G-|---4------------------------------4----4----4----4---|-
D-|---5-----5--5-----5--5----4-------4----4----4----4---|-  ...repeat
A-|---5-----5--5-----5--5----4-------2----2----2----2---|-
E-|---3-----3--3-----3--3----2--------------------------|-
      G                      F#5     Bm
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="chord-progressions">Chord progressions</h2>

<p>If we ignore the lyrics for a moment, hereâ€™s a look at the chord progressions for the entire song. Iâ€™ve mapped these out measure by measure, so you can get a big picture view on how the timing works. Personally, this always helps me memorize things quite a bit more quickly.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>INTRO

                                 ...repeat, with guitar riff

                                         ...repeat as needed
