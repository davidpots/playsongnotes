<h2 id="editors-notes">Editorâ€™s notes</h2>

<p>In this lesson, Iâ€™ll teach you how to play â€œMe and Bobby McGeeâ€ on guitar. Originally written by Kris Kristofferson, this lesson is more influenced by the Janis Joplin version of the song. This is one of the first songs I learned on guitar! Iâ€™ll show you the chords needed, the strumming pattern, and explain how to change keys midway through the song.</p>

<p>Note, the Janis Joplin version of this song changes key halfway through the song (from G to A). Chords for both keys are shown below.</p>

<h2 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming pattern</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s the strum pattern I use for this song. On the first down strum Iâ€™ll emphasize the bassiest string of the chord (or, if not the single bass-most string, the bassiest 2-3 strings).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>G
Busted flap in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
           G                           D7
When I was feelinâ€™ near as faded as my jeans
D7                       
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
     D7                         G    C/G  G
That rode us all the way to New Orleans

  G   
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
      G                  G7             C
I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
C                                  G
Windshield wipers flappin' time, I... was holding Bobbyâ€™s hand in mine
D7
We sang every song that driver knew

C                               G
Freedomâ€™s just another word for nothing left to lose
    D7                                        G      G7
And nothing, I mean nothing, hon, if it ainâ€™t free
    C                            G
And feeling good when was easy, lord, when he sang the blues
         D7                              
You know feeling good was good enough for me...
   D7                                G
...Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

         A
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
      A                              E7
Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
        E7
Through all kinds of weather to everything weâ€™ve done
     E7                            A
Yeah Bobby, baby, kept me from the cold

    A
One day up near Salinas, lord, I let him slip away
     A                A7                 D
Heâ€™s looking for that home and I hope he finds it
        D                              A
But Iâ€™d trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
      E7
To be holdinâ€™ Bobbyâ€™s body next to mine

D                               A
Freedomâ€™s just another word for nothing left to lose
    E7                                  A    A7
And nothing, thatâ€™s all that Bobby left me
    D                                 A
And feeling good when was easy, lord, when he sang the blues
    E7   
And feeling good was good enough for me... hmmm...
   E7                                A
...Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
