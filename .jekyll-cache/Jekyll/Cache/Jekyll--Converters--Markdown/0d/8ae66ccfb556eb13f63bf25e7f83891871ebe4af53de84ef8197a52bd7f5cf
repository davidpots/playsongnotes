<p>Here’s a guitar lesson for the 2015 song “Sedona” by the band Houndmouth. This is one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite albums of the past five years (writing this in 2020) – and I cannot recommend you listening to it enough. This song in particular is in E-flat, but we’ll be using a capo on the 3rd fret to allow us to play it in the key of C. The whole song can be played with C-F-G, but by using a few possible approaches for the intro &amp; verse riff, we can add quite a bit of substance and nuance to the song.</p>

<p>Timestamps for my video lesson:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0:18 Full playthrough</li>
  <li>3:46 Capo &amp; basic chord shapes</li>
  <li>5:57 Chord modifications</li>
  <li>9:32 Intro riff: basic melody</li>
  <li>12:04 Intro riff: alternate picking</li>
  <li>14:41 Strumming the verse &amp; chorus</li>
</ul>
