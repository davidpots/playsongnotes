<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor‚Äôs notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends! Here‚Äôs a quick question &amp; answer video, where I‚Äôll talk about walk-ups and walk-downs, giving a quick to-the-point overview of what these are, when to use them, and how they work. This question comes in from Patreon supporter Bill, who wrote:</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúDavid, could you address walk ups and downs. Are there standard ones for each chord transition (a - c, c- g etc.). They really make a huge difference. I‚Äôm not sure where to start in adding them.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>In answering Bill‚Äôs question, I‚Äôll be showing the tool FretMonster which I‚Äôve built and you can access <a href="https://playsongnotes.com/fretmonster">via this link</a>. This tool can help you visualize the notes in any key you pick, as shown on the fretboard. Also, the tool lets you change between seeing the notes with their name (e.g., C, F, G), or view those same notes but with their scale degree (e.g. 1, 4, 5). This can be a helpful way to see the notes of a scale in action, as they‚Äôre positioned on the fretboard. And of course, I‚Äôll explain how walk-ups and walk-downs are essentially using these exact notes. Check out my video above for more!</p>
