<p>Here‚Äôs an acoustic lesson for ‚ÄúSurf Rider‚Äù, an instrumental song by Lively Ones best known for its use in the Pulp Fiction end credits. It features a distinct bassline intro, followed by a very memorable melody riff that repeats throughout the song. I‚Äôll teach you both of these things, walking you through some very beginner friendly ways to get up to speed. From there, you‚Äôll be setup for success if you want to learn the remaining parts of the solo (which I don‚Äôt cover in this lesson).</p>

<p>Timestamps for my video:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0:00 Playthrough &amp; overview</li>
  <li>1:38 Intro riff</li>
  <li>14:02 Main riff - basics</li>
  <li>21:38 Main riff - misc tricks</li>
</ul>

<p>Here‚Äôs my favorite acoustic version of this song, found on YouTube. I initially hoped to play it like this guy does ‚Äì and maybe one day I will! But he‚Äôs using some very well executed fingerstyle technique that I don‚Äôt have under my control yet. So, for my initial lesson I kept things on the more accessible side‚Ä¶ maybe one day I‚Äôll come back to this song and play it like him.</p>
