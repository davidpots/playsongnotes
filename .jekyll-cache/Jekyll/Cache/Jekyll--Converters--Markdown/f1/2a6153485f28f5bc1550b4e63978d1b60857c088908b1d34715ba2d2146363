<p>Hey friends! Hereâ€™s a brand new lesson for the Billy Strings song â€œEnough to Leave,â€ which several of you wrote in suggesting I check out. While itâ€™s easy to associate Billy Strings with virtuoso bluegrass guitar licks played at a breakneck speed â€“ I appreciate this song for how relatively basic &amp; straightforward it is. A common strumming pattern, standard chords â€“ and heartfelt lyrics expressing sadness at the sudden loss of two good friends. As per the licks nâ€™ fills that Billyâ€™s music is known for â€“ I do teach some of those here, but theyâ€™re a bit simplified â€“ just because I canâ€™t play exactly like him, and wanted to make this song accessible for all. Beyond that, Iâ€™ll show you the usual: the chords, the progressions, talk about strumming tips, show tabs for the intro &amp; a few other fills, and then end things with a full play-through.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy! If you want more Billy Strings, I also did <a href="https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/279/">a lesson for classic song Summertime</a> that he covered with Marcus King â€“ where I similarly show relatively simplified versions of the licks and fills he plays.</p>

<h2 id="chord-shapes">Chord shapes</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s the chord shapes youâ€™ll need to play this song. These are ordered by when they appear in the song (e.g., G to Bm to Em is how things begin). For the D, also get comfortable with removing your finger from the thinnest string, to play a Dsus2 (xx0230) which Billy uses a lot.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“

<h2 id="chord-progressions">Chord progressions</h2>

<p>This song is in the key of G and is played at a tempo of 147 beats per minute. Hereâ€™s the chord progressions used in the verse and chorus sections.</p>

<p>Verse (play this twice):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>G               Bm              Em              Em

C               G               D               D
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Chorus (play this twice):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>D               Bm              D               G

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming pattern</h2>

<p>To get started, I recommend getting comfortable doing a single down-strum on the 1 and 3 counts. Use this to get familiar with the chord shapes, the transitions, and the overall progressions.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +    
D       D          "down... down..."
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From there, you can move to the â€œfullâ€ strumming pattern â€“ which is adding an â€œdown-upâ€ on the final two eighth notes of each measure.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D       D   D U    "down... down, down up"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="simplifying-chord-transitions-with-chordless-strums">Simplifying chord transitions with â€œchordlessâ€ strums</h2>

<p>A fun trick to use while strumming this song, which actually makes it easier to play â€“ is to remove your hands from each chord on or just after the â€œ4â€ count of each measure. Youâ€™ll want to keep strumming with your right hand â€“Â and the final â€œdown upâ€ of each measure will be played with no fingers on the fretboard. This is so your left-hand has an extra eighth note (or two) to get into the next chordâ€™s position. See my video lesson for reference.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>See PDF for diagram.

<h2 id="runs-and-fills">Runs and fills</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s some approximated versions of the main riffs, runs, and fills you hear during this song. Note, Iâ€™m simplifying all these partially, because I cannot play with the speed or agility of Billy. If you want the full what-Billy-plays tabs check out Lessons With Marcel. Otherwise, Iâ€™m here to serve us mortals.</p>

<h3 id="intro-riff">Intro riff</h3>

<p>The intro is 8 measures of E-minor, beginning with a raked strum (from thinnest to thickest string). Start your counting when you play the thickest (final) note of the raked chord. After that, thereâ€™s a bit of light &amp; free strumming â€“ with a small riff Billy plays which I show below. Return to an E-minor, and then slowly build up during your final 8 strums before starting the verse.</p>
