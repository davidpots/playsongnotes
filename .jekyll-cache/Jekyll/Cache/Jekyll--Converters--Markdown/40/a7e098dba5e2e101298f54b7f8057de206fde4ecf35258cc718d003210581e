<p>Hey friends! In this lesson Iâ€™ll teach you how to play the fingerstyle introduction to â€œMy Old Kentucky Home, Goodnightâ€ as covered by John Prine. Iâ€™ll teach you the three chords (including the variations needed for each), explain the alternating bass notes your right thumb will need to play, talk about the hammer-ons youâ€™ll add, and break down the fingerstyle one phrase at a time. This one took me a few weeks to get comfortable with, but patience and practice paid off â€“ and Iâ€™m excited to share these notes with you.</p>
