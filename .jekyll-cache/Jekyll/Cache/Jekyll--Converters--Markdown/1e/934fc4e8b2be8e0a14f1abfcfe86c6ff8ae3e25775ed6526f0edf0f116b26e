<p>Hey friends! In this lesson I‚Äôll teach you how to play ‚ÄúPeace of Mind‚Äù by Tyler Childers (track 7 off his 2nd album, ‚ÄúCountry Squire‚Äù). This is a very straightforward waltz-strumming song that only uses three chords. I‚Äôll not only teach the chords, but explain a few ways to step-by-step get used to the 3/4-time strumming pattern ‚Äì¬†including the alternating bass note technique. I hope you enjoy! And I very highly recommend this entire album from Childers ‚Äì I‚Äôve had it on repeat. While the guitar parts don‚Äôt stand out as much as they do in his first album, his songwriting and vocals are A+ in my book.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what I cover in this lesson:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0:00 Playthrough &amp; overview</li>
  <li>1:14 Capo &amp; chords</li>
  <li>1:52 Strumming: waltz basics</li>
  <li>4:33 Strumming: alternating bass notes (with tabs)</li>
  <li>6:30 Verse</li>
  <li>9:03 Chorus</li>
  <li>10:06 Farewell</li>
</ul>

VERSE, PART 1
              E
    He drinks orange juice and vodka, in the basement while she's talking
        E                                            B7
    To someone long distance, for hours and hours on end
        B7
    And as he's slowly sippin', he thinks about his children
            B7                                                   E
    And the heart attacks that youngest daughter's always giving him

VERSE, PART 2
                   E
        He ain't smoked no marijuana, since he got on with the railroad
                  E                                                   A
        And he's been on with the railroad, for a long and lonesome while
                 A                           E
        But the day that he retires, he'll smoke himself to China
              B7                                                   E
        He'll leave behind his worries, as he's racing through the sky

CHORUS
                         A                    E                 B7                 E
            The days are dark... down in the holler... Waitin' for... the sun to shine
                    A                       E                   B7               E
            On the back... you have been breakin'... tryin' to earn... peace of mind

              E
    She sells Avon to her buddies... and saves a little money
            E                                           B7
    On the makeup she's been using... to hide away the years
            B7
    And she sits and watches TV... usually every evening
             B7                                                        E
    If there ain't some kind of ballgame... that her daughter has to cheer

                    E
        She sneaks menthols in the mornin'... while her family's still snorin'
            E                                                 A
        And as she burns the Eggo's... she looks back at her life
             A                                       E
        That heart she broke in high school... he's singing on the Opry
             B7                                                   E
        She wonders what the hell... that she was thinkin' at the time

            [ CHORUS ]

    Their [E] youngest daughter Stella... she's running with this fell
    That [E] he cannot stand the thought of... that he surely does de[B7]spise
    He's [B7] told her he best never... see the two of them together
    But it's [B7] hard to keep an eye on her... when you're workin' all the [E] time

        There are [E] things he needs to tend to... and the bills the bank keeps sendin'
        Lord, the [E] zeros on the end keep pushing further to the [A] right
        Like a [A] freight train haulin' sorrow... and [A] movin' ever onward
        Through the [B7] tunnel of forever... to the never endin' [E] light
