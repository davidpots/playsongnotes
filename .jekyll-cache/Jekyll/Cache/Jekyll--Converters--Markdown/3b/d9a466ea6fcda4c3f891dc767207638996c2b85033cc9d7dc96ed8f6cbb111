<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“1â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“

<h2 id="chord-progressions">Chord progressions</h2>

<p>This one is pretty straightforward. Thereâ€™s three main chunks to memorize.</p>

<p>First, the verse. Note that there are a few times in the Sublime version where Bradley slips in an A-minor in place of a G, for some of the chords. This was probably because the song was recorded under what sounds like casual circumstances â€“ some free play is not to be surprising.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"Maybe one breath away..."

C . . . G . . . C . . . G . . .     x2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, the start of the chorus (if you can call it that).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"I don't know if I can..."

C . . . Am . . . C . . . Am . . .   x1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Third, the turnaround (end of the chorus). Immediately after this, youâ€™ll begin the next verse (return to C).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"Mary baby, please don't fuss and fight"

F . . . F . . . D . G .
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="lyrics-with-chords">Lyrics with chords</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C         G           C                G
Maybe one breath away... I'll find the words to say
C               G               C              G
...I'll sit and light the bong... I'll hold my hit in real long

    C               Am          C       Am            F
    ...I don't know if I can... go up inside of you tonight
       (F)           D            G
    Oh, Mary baby... please don't fuss and fight

C                   Am
...You've heard the line before...
      C                 G
Mary, baby please don't think I'm a whore
C              G                       C
...If you come home to me turn off the lights...
                                 G
And lock up the doors, and start getting busy

    C               Am        C            Am           F
    ...I don't know if I can, go so far up inside you tonight
       (F)        D       G
    Oh, Mary baby I could do it right

C              G           C                   G
...When we got to the pad... Mary baby started calling me her dad
C           Am            C              G
...Yes, she gave me head... we could not find a damn bed

    C                Am            C             Am
    ...Fifteen years old plus one, hotter than a microwave oven
    F                D        G           C
    ...Oh Mary baby, daddy is coming home
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="mini-verse-riff">Mini verse riff</h2>

<p>At the end of the chorus (the final G before you begin the C-Am-C-Am section), youâ€™ll often hear something like this. Hereâ€™s how I play itâ€¦ watch my video for context.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“

G â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
D â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“

      G                C
