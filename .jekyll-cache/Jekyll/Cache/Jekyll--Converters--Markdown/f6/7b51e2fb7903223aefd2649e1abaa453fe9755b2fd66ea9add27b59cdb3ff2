<p>Hey friends! here’s a new guitar lesson teaching you how to play Colter Wall’s 2018 song “Saskatchewan in 1881”. Instead of playing it fingerstyle like Colter does, I’m going to show you a strummed version (simply because I cannot pull off what Colter Wall is able to do with his fingers￼). While I am simplifying it in this regard, there’s plenty of room for fun – through alternating bass notes with your strumming, as well as walk-ups and walk-downs in each of the verse section￼s. I’ll teach all this and more!￼</p>

<p>Here is <a href="http://www.banthamlegend.com/Saskatchewan-in-1881/">a lesson</a> from another teacher if you want to learn it fingerstyle, like Colter plays it. This teacher has a printable tab showing the exact fingerpicking notes. Here’s his video:</p>
