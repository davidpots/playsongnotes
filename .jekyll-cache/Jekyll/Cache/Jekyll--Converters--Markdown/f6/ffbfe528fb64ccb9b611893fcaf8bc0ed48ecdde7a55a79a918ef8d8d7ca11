<p>In this quick practice tip, Iâ€™ll show you how to play the dreaded B minor chord. B minor is one of the first barre chords youâ€™ll run into â€“ which can be difficult to learn. Iâ€™ll walk you through it step by step, showing you how to play it with and without barring your index finger. This is a fantastic â€œfirstâ€ barre chord to learn, as it is far easier than playing F. Best of all, learning B minor will help you build the finger muscles youâ€™ll need to finally learn F too :)</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the quick diagram, with finger positions noted. See my video for more detail!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“  &lt;-- left index finger (barred)
B â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“  &lt;-- left middle finger
G â€“â€“â€“4â€“â€“â€“  &lt;-- left pinky finger
D â€“â€“â€“4â€“â€“â€“  &lt;-- left ring finger
A â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“  &lt;-- left index finger (barred)
E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
     Bm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>NOTE: From 1:25 to 2:23, I forgot to update the chord graphic I have on the screen. This is the part where I talk about putting your index finger down to barre the 2nd fret. If youâ€™re viewing on a large screen (desktop or laptop), youâ€™ll see the YouTube annotations I added to semi-correct this. On mobile, though, you wonâ€™t see this â€“ so just be aware. I do show the proper chart at the beginning and end of the video (x24432).</p>
