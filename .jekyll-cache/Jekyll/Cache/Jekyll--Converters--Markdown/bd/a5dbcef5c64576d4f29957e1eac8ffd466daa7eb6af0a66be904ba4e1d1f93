<p>Hey friends! Hereâ€™s a new lesson for the classic tune â€œYouâ€™ve Lost that Lovinâ€™ Feelinâ€™â€ by the Righteous Brothers (1964) â€“Â which you may also know from the famous bar-singing scene in Top Gun. Iâ€™ll teach you an arrangement based off the Mike MassÃ© cover on YouTube â€“ which makes for a fantastic solo acoustic version of this song. Iâ€™ll show the chords, progressions, strumming patterns, and more. Note Iâ€™m in standard tuning to keep things as approachable as possible (tune down 1/2 step if you want to play along w/ the Righteous Bros or Mike MassÃ©â€™s version).</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the timestamps for my video:</p>

<p>Great cover here by Mike MassÃ© and Sterling Cottam. Canâ€™t recommend it enough, and likewise totally recommend all the other great music that Mike puts out (Sterling has been a guest on a few of his videos, such as â€œCanâ€™t Help Falling in Loveâ€).</p>

<h2 id="tuning-notes">Tuning notes</h2>

<p>To play this song along with the Righteous Brothers version of this song, tune your guitar down 1/2 step and use the chords I show you. Note that Mike MassÃ©â€™s YouTube cover of this song also uses guitars tuned down 1/2 step. By ear, this song is in the key of C#.</p>

<h2 id="chord-shapes">Chord shapes</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s the tabs for the chord shapes I use in my lesson. Note that the â€œD7sus2â€ may likely have some other name (e.g., Cadd6/D) â€“Â but regardless of the name, just learn the shape below and put it to use.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“
B â€“â€“â€“â€“1â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“
G â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“
D â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“4â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“
A â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“4â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“
E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
   D7sus2 D   Em  F#m  G   A   
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="chord-progressions">Chord progressions</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s how to play each section of the song. Think of this as being in the key of D, with the D7sus2 being the â€œweirdâ€ chord one not usually heard in that keyâ€¦ but hey, it sounds great!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>VERSE
"You never close your eyes..."
| D7sus2 . . . | D7sus2 . . . | D . . . | D . . . |
| D7sus2 . . . | D7sus2 . . . | D . . . | D . . . |

PRE-CHORUS
"You're trying hard not to show it..."
| Em . . . | F#m . . . | G . . . | A . . . |

CHORUS
"You've lost that loving feeling..."
| D . . . | Em . . . | A      . . . | D      . . . |
| D . . . | Em . . . | D7sus2 . . . | D7sus2 . . . |
                                     ...resolve to D

REFRAIN
"Baby baby, I get down on my knees for you..."
| D . G . | A . G . | D . G . | A . G . |
                                ...repeat
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming pattern</h2>

<p>For a simple strumming pattern, use this straightforward pattern of only playing down-strums on the 1 and 3 counts.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D       D             "down.... down...."
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For a full strumming pattern, I recommend this. Itâ€™s what Mike MassÃ© uses in his cover, which is worth listening to for context.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D   D U   U D U       "down, down up, up down up"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For the refrain I use this strum pattern. The reason is all chord changes are happening on the 1
and 3 counts, which we want to pair with downstrums. Iâ€™ve accented the 1 and 3 counts below to
reflect this.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D   D U D   D U           "DOWN, down up, DOWN, down up"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="refrain-doo-wop-sounding-bass-line">Refrain â€œdoo wopâ€-sounding bass line</h2>

<p>In my playthrough, I play the following bass line (all on the 4th string) when I first get to the refrain. Start off by getting a hang of the 5th and 7th frets (played with left index and left ring, respectively):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“
B â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“
G â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“
D â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“5â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“7â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“5â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“0â€“  ....repeat
A â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“
E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then from there, you can play the following, which repeats each note on the â€œ+â€ count just before you switch to the next note. This can be tricky, but it adds a nice rhythmic sound!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“
B â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“|â€“â€“â€“
