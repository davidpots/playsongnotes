<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor‚Äôs notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends! Here‚Äôs a quick rhythm technique video, where I talk about sus chords, strumming, and syncopation ‚Äì which latter term referring to strumming on the ‚Äúoff‚Äù beat. Even if you don‚Äôt know what these terms mean, I‚Äôm certain your ear will immediately hear what I‚Äôm talking about. A great many songs use sus chords (e.g., Dsus2, Asus4, etc) ‚Äì and they‚Äôre often played in a way where syncopation is embraced. I wanted to do a quick deep dive into this topic, and visually show via my PDF diagram what exactly is going on with this technique. I hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a podcast episode of <a href="https://musicstudent101.com/86-syncopation.html">Music Student 101</a> where they talk at length about syncopation, breaking it down into simple terms. The examples they play are especially helpful. I recommend for sure!</p>
