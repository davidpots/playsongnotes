<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C         G/B            Am               G                 
...Betty, I won't make assumptions, about why you switched your
F/C                F/C                     G      G
Homeroom, but... I think it's 'cause of me....

C         G/B            Am           G
...Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
       F/C                       F/C                      G     G
When I passed your house... It's like I couldn't breathe...

C                G/B           Am              Am/G       
...You heard the rumors from Inez, you can't believe a word
    F/C                     F/C                 G     G
She says, most times... but this time it was true...
  
        Am           G       C    F/C        Am      G         F/C   F/C   G   G
    The worst, thing that, I ever did... was what, I did... to you----

                      C                 G/B              Am                 G     
        But if I just showed up at your party, would you have me? Would you want me?
                  F/C           Am                   G              G           
        Would you tell me to go straight to hell, or lead me to the garden?
               C                 G/B            Am              G             F/C
        In the garden, would you trust me, if I told you it was just a summer thing?
                 Am           G             G                   C        G/B  Am  G  F/C  Am  G  G
        I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything, but I know I miss you

[C]... Betty, [G/B] I know where it [Am] all went wrong, your [G] favorite song
Was [F/C] playing from the far side of the [G] gym
[C]... I was [G/B] nowhere to be [Am] found, I hate the [G] crowds
You know [F/C] that... plus I saw you dance with [G] him
[C]... You heard the [G/B] rumors from [Am] Inez, you can't [G] believe
A word she [F/C] says, most times, but this time it was [G] true

    The [Am] worst thing [G] that I [C] ever [F/C] did, was [Am] what I [G] did to [F/C] you-- [G]

        But if I just [C] showed up at your [G/B] party, would you [Am] have me, would you [G] want me
        Would you [F/C] tell me to go [Am] straight to hell... or [G] lead me to the garden?
        In the [C] garden would you [G/B] trust me if I [Am] told you it was [G] just a summer [F] thing
        I'm only [Am] seventeen, I [G] don't know anything, but I know I [C] miss you [G/B] [Am] [G] [F] [Am] [G] [G]

            [Am]...I was walking home on [G] broken cobblestones, just thinking
            [F] of you when she pulled up like... a [G] figment of my worst intentions
            [Am] she... said... "James, get in, let's [G] drive", those
            Days turned into [F] nights, slept next to her, but...[G]... I dreamt of you
            All summer [C] long [G/B] [Am] [G] [F] [F] [G] [G]

                1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
                Am        G   F                 Fm    

[C]...Betty, [G/B] I'm here on your [Am] doorstep, and I [G] planned it out
For [F] weeks now but, it's finally sinkin' [G] in
[C]...Betty, [G/B] right now is the [Am] last time I can [G] dream about
What [F] happens when you see my face [G] again

    The [Am] only [G] thing that I [C] wanna [F] do, is [Am] make it [G] up to [F] you-- [G]

So, I [C] showed up at your [G/B] party...[Am]...[G]...[F]...[Am]...[G]...[G]...
Yeah, I [C] showed up at your [G/B] party...[Am]...[G]...[F]...[Am]...[G]...[G]...

        Yeah, I [D] showed up at your [A/C#] party, will you [Bm] have me? Will you [A] love me?
        Will you [G] kiss me on the [Bm] porch in front of [A] all your stupid [A] friends?
        If you [D] kiss me, will it [A/C#] be just like I [Bm] dreamed it? Will it [A] patch your broken [G] wings?
        I'm only [Bm] seventeen, I [A] don't know any-[A] thing, but I know

                I [D] miss you....[A] [G-G]...Standing in your...[D] cardigan... [A] [G-G]
                Kissing in my...[D] car again... [A] [G-G]... stopped at a streetlight
                You know I miss [D] you.... [A] [G, let ring, end]
