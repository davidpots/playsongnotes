<p>Hey there friends! I want to share a brand new &amp; updated PDF I made for Paul Simon’s Kodachrome –– and while I’m at it dive a bit deeper into some other gems when it comes to his guitar playing. This includes my earlier lesson for Mrs. Robinson, as well as a brief look at Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard. I have PDFs for all of these available via the button just above – and in my video I’ll give an overview of each of the print-friendly PDFs I’ve created for these songs.</p>

<p>This is a song I don’t have a lesson for as of now, but my text-only draft PDF (that I show in the video above) is available here to Patreon supporters. Look for a lesson coming on that eventually!</p>

<h3 id="the-sound-of-silence">The Sound of Silence</h3>

<p>This is likewise a song I haven’t learned yet, but due to a huge nunmber of requests I’ve started to learn. Look for a lesson coming very soon (subscribe on YouTube to stay in the loop).</p>
