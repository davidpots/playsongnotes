<h2 id="chords-needed">Chords needed</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E ––(1)––(1)––0–––1–––0––––
B –––1––––3–––1–––3–––2––––
G –––2––––3–––0–––2–––2––––

     F   Bb   C   Dm  A
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="capo-to-make-things-easier">Capo to make things easier?</h2>

<p>If you want, you can dodge the B-flat and F chords by using a capo (which lets you play along with the album version of this song). I won’t break it down in detail here, but the cheat sheet to do such is this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>          I  III  IV  V  vi
          ----------------------
No Capo   F   A   Bb  C  Dm    
Capo 1    E   G#  A   B  C#m
Capo 3    D   F#  G   A  Bm
Capo 5    C   E   F   G  Am
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note, you’ll need to use barre chords one way or another, for the most part.</p>

<h2 id="chord-progression">Chord progression</h2>

<p>Intro / verse / pre-chorus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Bb . . . F . . . C . . . Dm . . . (repeat)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Chorus / post-chorus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>A . Bb . F . C . (repeat)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="strumming">Strumming</h2>

<p>Use all down strums, ideally accenting every other strum. Throw in a down-up just before every chord change:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>DOWN down DOWN down DOWN down DOWN down up
DOWN down DOWN down DOWN down DOWN down up
DOWN down DOWN down DOWN down DOWN down up

etc
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="lyrics">Lyrics</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Lighting stog after stog, choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more

Tell me what I wantjust keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup,
blunt after blunt I wouldn't give one
if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha

    In the cut and I put that on my momma
    And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
    I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
    It's either the pussy or the commas

        Man I just wanna go flex
        Gold on my teeth and on my neck
        And I'm stone cold with the flex
        With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
        (repeat)

Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me

She sending all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know whats about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go

    [ chorus x 1 ]

        Knowing all of this
        It just don’t make a difference
        I’m just talking shit to the ones that will listen
        I come with the heat man, I swear I’m never missing
        And I’m still the same and I swear I’m never switching
        (repeat)

    [ chorus x 2 ]
