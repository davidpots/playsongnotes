<p>In this lesson, I want to show you how I went about creating a country guitar version (in the style of Johnny Cash) for the song “Jenny of Oldstones” – which was sung in the latest Game of Thrones episode. The song left quite an impression on me upon watching it, and I decided I’d try to work out an acoustic guitar part to match the melody. I’ll explain how I figured out the key of the song, worked out the melody, established a “home base” groove, and experimented with the bass notes within my strumming. In all, this has been a memorable song to learn – and it’s my pleasure to share with you this lesson. Enjoy!</p>
