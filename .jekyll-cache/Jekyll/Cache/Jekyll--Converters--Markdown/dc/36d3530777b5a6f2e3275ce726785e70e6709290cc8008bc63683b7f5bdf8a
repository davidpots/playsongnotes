<p>Hey friends! Quick lesson here showing you 3 different ways to silence the strings using your fretting (left) hand. This is an valuable technique to use in various circumstances, as sometimes you’ll want to stop/silence/punctuate/mute the ringing strings for percussive reasons – and based on context of what you’re playing, there’s a few different approaches you’ll need to take. I’ll show you 3 such examples (with close-up photos of my hand) on how to do this, and follow them up with a specific song-based exercise (with tabs) to help you practice. Enjoy!</p>
