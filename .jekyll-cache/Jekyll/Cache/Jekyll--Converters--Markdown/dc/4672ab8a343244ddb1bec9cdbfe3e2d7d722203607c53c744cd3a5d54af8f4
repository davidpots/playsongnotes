<h2 id="editors-notes">Editorâ€™s notes</h2>

<p>This lesson shows you an easy way to play â€œLast Kissâ€ as covered by Pearl Jam. Iâ€™ll show you the chords needed, talk about transitioning between chords easily, and tackle the strumming pattern. This is a fun song to learn, as it only uses 4 chords repeating for the entire song: G-Em-C-D. Good luck!</p>

<h2 id="chords-needed">Chords needed</h2>

<p>The entire song uses these four chords, in this order, over and over. Very straight forward. For the G, you can play the 3rd fret on the B string if you want - thatâ€™s a correct way to play G also.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
B â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“1â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
G â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
D â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
A â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
E â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
      G     Em    C     D
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As I note in my video lesson, if youâ€™re having trouble with the chord transitions, realize that for some of the transitions youâ€™re keeping fingers on the same note. This makes changing much easier, since it is one less finger to move. For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“
B â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“
G â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“
D â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“
A â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“   &lt;-- index finger plays 2nd fret for both chords
E â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“
      G     Em   
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And also for the Em to the C:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“
B â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“1â€“â€“â€“â€“
G â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“
D â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“   &lt;-- middle finger plays the 2nd fret for both chords
A â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“
E â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
      Em    C    
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And finally, for the D to G turnaround:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“
B â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“  &lt;-- ring finger plays the 3rd fret for both chords
G â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“
D â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“
A â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“
E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“
      D      G
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In general, keep an eye out for this sort of â€œpivot noteâ€ transition in any song youâ€™re learning. It can make many chord transitions much easier, and faster, to pull off while keeping in step with the songâ€™s rhythm.</p>

<h2 id="chord-progression-and-timing">Chord progression and timing</h2>

<p>Quite simply, youâ€™ll be doing one measure (four counts) of each chord, in sequence. That is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  
G  .  .  .  Em .  .  .  C  .  .  .  D  .  .  .
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I recommend counting out loud, if you can, to master the timing (if itâ€™s giving you trouble).</p>

<h2 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming pattern</h2>

<p>I recommend this strumming pattern for the whole song:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>D = down strum
U = up strum

1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
D     D  U     U  D  U
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Repeat this, playing the pattern once per each chord. If itâ€™s giving you trouble, simplify it and start with something you can do without much challenge. Such as</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
D     D     D     D
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From there, add an up-strum on the final â€œ4 +â€ count:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
D     D     D     D  U
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, once you have that, donâ€™t strum on the â€œ3â€ count:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
D     D           D  U
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And finally, one you have mastered that, add up strums on the â€œ2 +â€ and â€œ3 +â€ counts.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
D     D  U     U  D  U
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The key is to keep your strumming hand (arm) moving up and down continuously, but only bringing the pick down on the strings when the strumming pattern demands it.</p>

Oh where, oh where can my baby be
C                     D

G                               Em

    [C] We hadnâ€™t driven [D] very far
    [G] There in the road [Em] straight ahead
    [C] A car was stalled, the [D] engines dead â€¨        [G] I couldnâ€™t stop so I [Em] swerved to the right
    Iâ€™ll [C] never forget the [D] sound that night
    The [G] screaminâ€™ tires, the [Em] bustinâ€™ glass
    The [C] painful scream that [D] I----- heard [G] last

        [stay on G for 2 measures on "last"]

Oh [G] where, oh where can my [Em] baby be
[C] The lord took her [D] away from me
[G] Sheâ€™s gone to heaven so Iâ€™ve [Em] got to be good
So [C] I can see my baby when I [D] leave this [G] world

    When [G] I woke up the rain was [Em] pourinâ€™ down
    [C] There were people standing [D] all around
    [G] Something warm flowing [Em] through my eyes
    But [C] somehow I found... my [D] baby that night â€¨    I [G] lifted her head, she looked at [Em] me and said
    [C] Hold me darling, just a [D] little while
    I [G] held her close, I kissed her [Em] our last kiss
    I [C] found the love that I [D] knew I would miss

    Well, [G] now sheâ€™s gone, even [Em] though I hold her tight
    I [C] lost my love, my [D] life---- that [G] night

Oh [G] where, oh where can my [Em] baby be
[C] The lord took her [D] away from me
[G] Sheâ€™s gone to heaven so Iâ€™ve [Em] got to be good
So [C] I can see my baby when I [D] leave this [G] world

[G] Oooooh, ooo [Em] oooh..... [C] Ooooh, ooo [D] oooh...
