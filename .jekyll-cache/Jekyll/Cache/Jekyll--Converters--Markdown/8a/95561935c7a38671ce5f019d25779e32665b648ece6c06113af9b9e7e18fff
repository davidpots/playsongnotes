<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends! Here’s a new lesson for the classic tune “You’ve Lost that Lovin’ Feelin’” by the Righteous Brothers (1964) – which you may also know from the famous bar-singing scene in Top Gun. I’ll teach you an arrangement based off the Mike Massé cover on YouTube – which makes for a fantastic solo acoustic version of this song. I’ll show the chords, progressions, strumming patterns, and more. Note I’m in standard tuning to keep things as approachable as possible (tune down 1/2 step if you want to play along w/ the Righteous Bros or Mike Massé’s version).</p>

<p>Here’s the timestamps for my video:</p>

  <li>4:45 Chord progressions</li>

</ul>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="mike-massés-version-of-this-song">Mike Massé’s version of this song</h2>

<p>Great cover here by Mike Massé and Sterling Cottam. Can’t recommend it enough, and likewise totally recommend all the other great music that Mike puts out (Sterling has been a guest on a few of his videos, such as “Can’t Help Falling in Love”).</p>

<h2 id="tuning-notes">Tuning notes</h2>

<p>To play this song along with the Righteous Brothers version of this song, tune your guitar down 1/2 step and use the chords I show you. Note that Mike Massé’s YouTube cover of this song also uses guitars tuned down 1/2 step. By ear, this song is in the key of C#.</p>

<h2 id="chord-shapes">Chord shapes</h2>

<p>Here’s the tabs for the chord shapes I use in my lesson. Note that the “D7sus2” may likely have some other name (e.g., Cadd6/D) – but regardless of the name, just learn the shape below and put it to use.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E ––––0–––2–––0––––2–––3–––0–––
B ––––1–––3–––0––––2–––0–––2–––
G ––––2–––2–––0––––2–––0–––2–––
D ––––0–––0–––2––––4–––0–––2–––
A ––––––––––––2––––4–––2–––0–––
E ––––––––––––0––––2–––3–––––––
   D7sus2 D   Em  F#m  G   A   
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="chord-progressions">Chord progressions</h2>

<p>Here’s how to play each section of the song. Think of this as being in the key of D, with the D7sus2 being the “weird” chord one not usually heard in that key… but hey, it sounds great!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>VERSE
"You never close your eyes..."
| D7sus2 . . . | D7sus2 . . . | D . . . | D . . . |
| D7sus2 . . . | D7sus2 . . . | D . . . | D . . . |

PRE-CHORUS
"You're trying hard not to show it..."
| Em . . . | F#m . . . | G . . . | A . . . |

CHORUS
"You've lost that loving feeling..."
| D . . . | Em . . . | A      . . . | D      . . . |
| D . . . | Em . . . | D7sus2 . . . | D7sus2 . . . |
                                     ...resolve to D

REFRAIN
"Baby baby, I get down on my knees for you..."
| D . G . | A . G . | D . G . | A . G . |
                                ...repeat
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming pattern</h2>

<p>For a simple strumming pattern, use this straightforward pattern of only playing down-strums on the 1 and 3 counts.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D       D             "down.... down...."
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For a full strumming pattern, I recommend this. It’s what Mike Massé uses in his cover, which is worth listening to for context.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D   D U   U D U       "down, down up, up down up"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For the refrain I use this strum pattern. The reason is all chord changes are happening on the 1
and 3 counts, which we want to pair with downstrums. I’ve accented the 1 and 3 counts below to
reflect this.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D   D U D   D U           "DOWN, down up, DOWN, down up"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="refrain-doo-wop-sounding-bass-line">Refrain “doo wop”-sounding bass line</h2>

<p>In my playthrough, I play the following bass line (all on the 4th string) when I first get to the refrain. Start off by getting a hang of the 5th and 7th frets (played with left index and left ring, respectively):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–––
B –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–––
G –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–––
D –0–––––––5–––––––7–––––––5–––––––|–0–  ....repeat
A –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–––
E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–––
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then from there, you can play the following, which repeats each note on the “+” count just before you switch to the next note. This can be tricky, but it adds a nice rhythmic sound!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–––
B –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–––
G –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–––
D –0–––––0–5–––––5–7–––––7–5–7–––5–|–0–  ....repeat
A –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–––
E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––|–––
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
</code></pre></div></div>
