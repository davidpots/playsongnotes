<h2 id="chords-needed">Chords needed</h2>

<p>The entire song uses these four chords. There are plenty of ways you could embellish and modify these chords, such as turning the A-minor to a Am7 (x02010) – which is what it sounds like Bob Dylan does. Obviously feel free to do that if you wish.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E ––––3–––––0–––––0–––––2–––––
B ––––0–––––1–––––1–––––3–––––
G ––––0–––––2–––––0–––––2–––––
D ––––0–––––2–––––2–––––0–––––
A ––––2–––––0–––––3–––––––––––
E ––––3–––––––––––––––––––––––
      G     Am    C     D
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As I note in my video lesson, if you’re having trouble with the chord transitions, realize that for some of the transitions you’re keeping fingers on the same note. This makes changing much easier, since it is one less finger to move. For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E ––––3–––––2––––
B ––––3–––––3––––   &lt;-- left ring finger plays 3rd fret for both chords
G ––––0–––––2––––
D ––––0–––––0––––
A ––––2––––––––––
E ––––3––––––––––
      G     D   
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="chord-progression">Chord progression</h2>

<p>Repeat this for the entire song. Intro, verse, and chorus – they all use this basic progression. Remember, 4 counts per measure.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>G . . . D . . . Am . . . Am . . .
G . . . D . . . C  . . . C  . . .
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming pattern</h2>

<p>The ideal strumming pattern you should strive to play is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D       D   D U
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’re having trouble with this, start simple. Begin with a single downstrum on the “1” count of each 4-count measure:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D       
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you can do that, add another down strum to the 3 count:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1   2   3   4  
D       D
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that, add yet another down strum on the 4 count:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D       D   D
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And finally, when you can do what’s above reliably well enough, add a single upstrum on the “4 and” count:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D       D   D U
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Repeat this pattern for the entire song. Though of course, should you wish, you could get creative and use any strumming pattern you like.</p>

<h2 id="flourish-and-fills">Flourish and fills</h2>

<p>Here’s a few simple ways to spice up the simple chord progression used in this song.</p>

<h3 id="walk-down-from-c-to-g">Walk down from C to G</h3>

<p>At the end of every chorus, I often like to “walk down” from C to G, meaning I’ll play each individual bass note that connects to C to G. This sounds quite nice. Quite simply, you just need to play this. See my video lesson for reference.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E –––0–––––––––––––3––––
B –––1–––––––––––––3––––
G –––0–––––––––––––0––––
D –––2–––––––––––––0––––
A –––3–––3––2––0–––2––––
E –––––––––––––––––3––––
     C             G
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="using-your-pinky-on-the-high-e-string">Using your pinky on the high E-string</h3>

<p>In the Bob Dylan version, as well as my video lesson, you can hear times when there’s the high-E string ringing nicely – it’s because of an added pinky on either the C or the Am chord. Listen along for context, but quite simply, here’s how you play it:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E –––3–––––3––––    &lt;-- add your left pinky on this 3rd fret note
B –––1–––––1––––
G –––0–––––2––––
D –––2–––––2––––
A –––3–––––0––––
E ––––––––––––––
     C     Am
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These are just two of many possible ways you can spice up the song, but I hope this helps get you started.</p>

<h2 id="good-luck">Good luck!</h2>

<p>I hope this helps, and as always let me know if you have any questions.</p>
