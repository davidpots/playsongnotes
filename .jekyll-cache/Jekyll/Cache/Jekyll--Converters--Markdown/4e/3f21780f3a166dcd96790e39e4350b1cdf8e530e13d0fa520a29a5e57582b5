<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>Ever have trouble getting your fingers crammed together to play the A-major chord? You’re not alone! Here’s a simple technique you can use - where a simple tweak of your finger position can create a lot more breathing room for all of your fingers. Not only does this make the chord easier to switch to, but it actually makes certain common transitions (do D-major and E-major) easier than they were before.</p>

<h2 id="the-normal-way-to-play-a-major">The “normal” way to play A-major</h2>

<p>Usually, A-major is taught (and played) like this. Three fingers in a row, all on the 2nd fret. This may well be good enough for you – especially if your fingers aren’t huge, or if you’re playing on a large enough guitar.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/tip-18-a-shape-normal.jpg" /></p>

<p>However, a challenge with this finger positioning is things can get crammed when your fingers are in a straight line like this. For me, I have very little wiggle room - it’s quite frankly not comfortable. Luckily, there is another way…</p>

<h2 id="the-triangle-way-to-play-a-major">The “triangle” way to play A-major</h2>

<p>Here, we’re playing the same notes - but we’re using our left-hand fingers in a different way. Notice how the index finger is in the middle of the 3 notes, instead of on the far side. This creates a triangle shape, which actually allows for much more wiggle room around each finger. The result is a chord that’s quicker to switch to and more comfortable to play.</p>

<h2 id="easy-transitions-between-a-d-and-e">Easy transitions between A, D, and E</h2>

<p>A straight-up benefit for playing A-major in this manner, is your index finger will be on the same string that it’s used on the D-major and E-major chord - both of which are very frequently played along with the A-major chord. See my video for reference - switching between these three chords is a breeze when your index finger doesn’t have to ever change strings.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E –––0––––2––––0––––
B –––2––––3––––0––––
G –––2––––2––––1––––  &lt;== left index finger is used on this
D –––2––––0––––2––––      string for all 3 chords (good!)
A –––0–––––––––2––––
E –––––––––––––0––––
     A    D    E
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="you-can-still-play-asus2-and-asus4">You can still play Asus2 and Asus4</h2>

<p>Finally, a nice benefit of this chord voicing is that you can still play the common Asus2 and Asus4 chords just as you did before. Meaning, you’re using your left-hand pinky for the Asus4’s 3rd fret note - which feels 100% natural.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E –––0––––––0––––––0–––––
B –––2––––––3––––––0–––––
G –––2––––––2––––––2–––––
D –––2––––––2––––––2–––––
A –––0––––––0––––––0–––––
E –––––––––––––––––––––––
     A    Asus4   Asus2
</code></pre></div></div>
