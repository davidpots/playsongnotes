<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor‚Äôs notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends! Here‚Äôs a lesson showing you how to play the Ben E. King classic ‚ÄúStand By Me‚Äù with an acoustic guitar, no capo, key of C. Notably, I‚Äôm deviating from the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù key of this song (Key of A) in order to prioritize an ‚Äúeasy to play &amp; sounds just like the song‚Äù arrangement, which I trust you‚Äôll find helpful. I break the lesson into two halves: (1) learning the intro, and then (2) learning how to strum the verse &amp; chorus sections. Here‚Äôs timestamps for my video lesson:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0:00 Lesson overview</li>
  <li>2:10 Intro riff: the basics</li>
  <li>9:13 Intro riff: adding percussion</li>
  <li>16:02 Verse &amp; chorus strumming</li>
  <li>23:46 Full playthrough</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="notes-on-capo-and-key">Notes on capo and ‚Äúkey‚Äù</h2>

<p>Ben E. King‚Äôs version of this song is in the Key of A. Most guitar lessons show you how to play it in the key of G, using capo on 2nd fret. I don‚Äôt care for either of these options, when playing solo acoustic guitar. Why? Neither allows you to play the full bass line tab, due to the guitar ‚Äúnot going low enough‚Äù with regard to available bass notes. As such, I like to play it in the Key of C, which is what I do in my lesson.</p>

<p>If you do want to use the key of C and play along with Ben E. King‚Äôs version, slap a capo on the 9th fret.</p>
