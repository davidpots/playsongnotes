<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor‚Äôs notes</h2>

<p>Hey there friends! Another video on walk-ups &amp; walk-downs today, where I‚Äôll show you how you can use the fretboard as a visual aid when understanding what notes you‚Äôre playing. I covered a very similar topic <a href="http://playsongnotes.com/lessons/342/">back in lesson #342</a>, and after many requests, I‚Äôm explaining things a bit more ‚Äì this time with a brand new PDF for you to reference. I‚Äôll be looking at a common walk-up &amp; walk-down sequence, as it appears in five common musical keys (A, C, D, G, and E). For each key I‚Äôll show you the sample tab, as well as two different maps of the fretboard. My hope is this further helps you understand how walk ups &amp; walk downs work, when to use them, and where the notes are coming from.</p>

<p>Let me also remind you, my free web tool <a href="https://playsongnotes.com/fretmonster">FretMonster</a> is available for you to use to visualize the fretboard. It lets you select your desired key, and your desired scale (when in doubt, use the ‚Äúmajor‚Äù scale) ‚Äì and it shows you all the matching notes on the guitar fretboard. There‚Äôs other cool things you can do ‚Äì such as change the way the notes are labeled, as I reference in my video and PDF.</p>

<h2 id="my-other-lesson-on-this-topic">My other lesson on this topic</h2>

<p>Back in lesson 342 I initially covered this topic, from a slightly different angle. Here‚Äôs that video, if you want to compare my answers:</p>

<h2 id="lessons-that-use-walk-ups--walk-downs">Lessons that use walk-ups &amp; walk downs</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs a list of songs I‚Äôve made lessons for that utilize what I show in this video. These make for great additional practice if you want to open up FretMonster, set it to the key of any song below, and make out what scale degrees are being used in the walk-ups and walk-downs.</p>

<p>PDFs for each lesson are available via the links below!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Walk the Line</em> by Johnny Cash - this one is absolute treasure if you‚Äôre looking to see how these walk-ups &amp; walk-downs can be put to use. Cash uses three different keys in this song (changing the key with each verse), but always uses the same formula within each key. <a href="https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/6/">Watch the video &amp; get the PDF ¬ª</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground</em> by Willie Nelson - this one‚Äôs great because Willie embraces chromatic walk-ups &amp; walk-downs‚Ä¶ which basically means, he‚Äôs adding sharp (or flat?) notes between the ‚Äúmain‚Äù walkdown notes, traveling a half-step at a time within each connecting phrase. <a href="https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/135/">Watch the video &amp; get the PDF ¬ª</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Honky Tonk Heroes</em> by Waylon Jennings - the intro to this song is quite great, and has a subtle but important use of walk-ups &amp; walk-downs leading up to each chord. Similar to the Willie Nelson song above, some of these runs are chromatic. <a href="https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/94/">Watch the video &amp; get the PDF ¬ª</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Summertime</em> by Billy Strings &amp; Marcus King - a great example here of how just a few walk-up &amp; walk-down phrases are all you need to add a ton of character to a longer progression. In my lesson, I teach you how Billy plays it, but also a simpler way that still taps into the walk-up and walk-down spirit. <a href="https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/279/">Watch the video &amp; get the PDF ¬ª</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Kodachrome</em> by Paul Simon - while this one isn‚Äôt terribly heavy on the walk-ups and walk-downs, but there‚Äôs a few distinctive runs used during the intro riff (also heard in the verse) which further embrace chromaticism, which really spices things up. And such a great song! <a href="https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/20/">Watch the video &amp; get the PDF ¬ª</a></p>
