<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>Hello my friends! In is guitar lesson, I will teach you how to play The Sound of Silence, the 1966 classic from Simon and Garfunkel. I will be using a capo on 6th fret, matching how they play it. The song uses fingerstyle in verse 1, and is strummed for verses 2-5, all of which the same chord progression. I’ll teach you everything you need to know to play it: the chord shapes, the progression, how to approach the fingerstyle (beginner &amp; advanced techniques), and a few different ways to tackle the strumming. Lastly, I it all off with a full playthrough showing you everything put together in one package.</p>

<p>￼Because this is such a classic song, I wanted to go deep and be complete – hence this one being a little bit longer than normal. But with my timestamps, I trust you’ll be able to find what you’re looking for quickly. good luck, and enjoy!￼￼</p>

<h2 id="capo-and-key">Capo and key</h2>

<p>Add a capo 6th fret to play along with Simon and Garfunkel’s album version of this song.</p>

<p>Capo 6th fret  =  Key of A minor
   No Capo        =  Key D# minor (which is equal to Eb minor)</p>

<h2 id="chord-shapes-needed">Chord shapes needed</h2>

<p>Here’s how to play the five chords you’ll need in this song. The trickiest of these may be the F chord, but don’t feel like you need to play for six string barred version of F (which is often quite difficult for beginners). Instead, you can use any of the alternate voicings of the F that I show here – none of which require you to barre any of the strings.</p>

<!-- Common chord voicings:               Alt. voicings for F-major:

<h2 id="chords-progressions">Chords progressions</h2>

<p>Tempo is ~105 beats per minute. Each of the five verses uses a nearly identical chord progression, whether you’re playing fingerstyle (verse 1) or strumming (verses 2-5). Notice how in verses 3-5, measures #10 and #15 change their length, based on lyrical context. Also, the A-minor that ends each verse is the same as the A-minor that starts the verse that follows (in all cases, stay on this A-minor for two measures total).</p>

<h2 id="strumming-basics">Strumming basics</h2>

<p>If you’re just starting out, I would first get comfortable doing a single downstrum on the “1” and “3” counts of each measure (four counts total). This will help you get the hang of the strumming (while playing through each verse progression), without initially complicating the strumming pattern.</p>

<!-- 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +           
D       D -->

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ See PDF for strumming pattern #1 ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, I would bring in additional downstrums on the “2” and “4” counts – while also adding upstrums on the “+” (spoken as “and”) counts following those strums. Spoken aloud this would be “Down, down-up-down, down-up-down, down-up-down” which map to beats “One, two-and-three, four-and-one, two-and-three, four-and-one” (etc).</p>

<h2 id="strumming-with-flourish">Strumming with flourish</h2>

<p>If you want to level up your strumming and sound like Simon and Garfunkel’s album recording, here are tabs to use for each of the four chords that you strum. The idea here is to release some of the notes on the “+” count following the “2” and “4” beats, and then add them back on the following downstrum.</p>

<h2 id="fingerstyle-pattern-used">Fingerstyle pattern used</h2>

<p>There are two different ways you can approach the fingerstyle pattern used in the first verse. One of them uses your right thumb, right index, and right middle fingers – each of which gets their own “assigned” string for any chord. This approach uses more of your fingers (which is less efficient), but requires less jumping around (which keeps things simpler).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;!-- e ––––0–––0–– &lt;= r. middle    e –––––––––––                 e –––––––––––

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second approach uses only your right thumb and right index finger, with your right thumb alternating strings. This approach is more efficient (because you’re only using two fingers on your right-hand) but admittedly can be more difficult – because it demands higher coordination of your right thumb having to switch strings.</p>

<p>My advice: Spend time practicing both of these techniques! Doing so will allow you to use whichever is more comfortable to you. Ultimately, they are both good approaches is to be familiar with and have under your belt. For more info on these competing fingerstyle techniques, check out my lesson #302 which dives into this exact topic with plenty of examples: https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/302/</p>

<p>Here is a basic fingerstyle tab for the entire first verse. Again, this is not note-for-note how Simon and Garfunkel play the song. Instead, this plays the exact chords they’re using, but simplifies a few things (e.g. avoids using barre chords for the F major).</p>

<h2 id="fingerstyle-tab-how-i-like-to-play-it">Fingerstyle tab, how I like to play it</h2>

<p>Here’s how I like the finger pick this song. It largely uses the previous tab I showed, but adds a few things to spice the song up a bit. This includes an alternate finger position used for the first measure of G major, and adding walk-up and walk-down in measure 14. Ultimately, I encourage you to come up with an arrangement that works for you, should you want to add flourish in other ways to match your skill level, or match the vibe/sound you’re going for. Make it your own!</p>
