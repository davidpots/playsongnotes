    ...Now, he's a wino, tried and true

       F                       C               (walk up)
    He worked on farms, and he worked on cars

    [ use same progression for all verses ]

    It was white port, that put that look in his eye
    That grown men get when they need to cry
    And he sat down on the curb to rest
    His head just fell down on his chest

    He said "Every single day it gets
    A little bit harder to handle and yet"
    And he lost the thread and his mind got cluttered
    And the words just rolled off down the gutter

    Well he was elevator man in a cheap hotel
    In exchange for the rent on a one room cell
    He's old in years beyond his time
    Thanks to the world, and the white port wine

    So he says "Son," he always called me son
    He said, "Life for you has just begun"
    And he told me a story that I heard before
    How he fell in love with a Dallas whore

    Well, he could cut through the years to the very night
    When it ended in a whore house fight
    And she turned his last proposal down
    In favor of being a girl about town

    Now, it's been seventeen years right in line
    And he ain't been straight none of the time
    Too many days of fightin' the weather
    And too many nights of not being together

    So he died... [ Intro x2 ]

    When they went through his personal effects
    In among the stubs from the welfare checks
    Was a crumblin' picture of a girl in a door
    An address in Dallas, and nothin' more

    The welfare people provided the priest
    A couple from the Mission down the street
    Sang Amazing Grace, and no one cried
    Except some woman in black, way off to the side

    We all left and she was standing there
    Black veil covering her silver hair
    And 'ole One-Eyed John said her name was Alice
    And she used to be a whore in Dallas

    So let him roar, Lord let him roll
    Bet he's gone to Dallas, rest his soul
    Just, let him roll... Lord, let him roar
    He always said that heaven was just a Dallas whore

<p>Hereâ€™s the 3 main chord shapes needed (basically, C F and G). For the F, Iâ€™ll sometimes call it â€œFadd6â€ as youâ€™re often going to have your left pinky on the 3rd fret of the B string. If you want to strum, simply use any C F G voicings you prefer - or follow the positions shown here.</p>

<p>When learning the chords, if your goal is to play in Travis picking style â€“ at some point youâ€™ll want to practice going in and out of all of these positions for each chord.

<h2 id="learning-how-to-travis-pick-this-song">Learning how to Travis Pick this song</h2>

<p>If you want to learn this song the way I perform it in my video, and especially if Travis Picking isnâ€™t something youâ€™ve mastered â€“ I recommend the following steps. It took me ~2 weeks of practice to get a hang of this, with about ~15 minutes of practice per day on average. Progress was slow, and sometimes felt impossible, but slowly it got easier and easier. Hereâ€™s the steps I followed (spent a few days on each).</p>

<h3 id="learn-the-alternating-bass-notes">Learn the alternating bass notes</h3>

<p>After you learn the chord shapes (or while youâ€™re learning them), I recommend being able to get your right thumb to play these alternating bass note patterns to the point where you can do it without too much conscious thought. It gets a lot tricker once you had the melody notes, so learn this good!</p>
