<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends! Here’s a lesson teaching you how to play the classic song “Summertime”, specifically using the Billy Strings guitar arrangement from his cover with Marcus King. In my first lesson (#279), I’ll be covering the 80% broad-stroke core of what Billy plays: chords, the progression, basic strumming, and some muting techniques. In a separate video (#316) I’ll teach you the exact strumming, runs &amp; fills Billy plays – but watch this one first if you’re just getting started with the song, as that other lesson builds off of this one. Note that this version of the song is similar, but not exactly the same to the Doc Watson version.</p>

<h2 id="the-version-im-basing-my-lesson-on">The version I’m basing my lesson on</h2>

<p>This lesson is based on the Billy Strings &amp; Marcus King cover of this song, which was posted to the Carter Vintage Guitars YouTube channel in March 2019. I’m not going to presume this is the “only” way Billy has played this song – so when it comes to my arrangement, keep this in mind and stray off the path if you want.</p>

<p>I should note, the Billy &amp; Marcus version above is very much similar to the Doc Watson version, which can be seen here:</p>

<p>Here’s the chord voicings I’m using.</p>

<h3 id="mastering-the-em-df-g">Mastering the Em-D/F#-G</h3>

<p>This was the trickiest part for me, when picking up this song from scratch. For what I’m calling the D/F#, specifically (which in reality is probably a D6/F# or something else) – it took me a while to get comfortable with the transition from the G. Note, I have additional tips on strumming these chords further below.</p>

B ––0––                 B ––0––                 B ––3–– &lt;= L.ring

<h3 id="the-other-chords">The other chords</h3>

<p>The rest of the chords are more straightforward. Note for the C, Billy looks like he does a C/G sometimes (332010). Likewise, for the B7 note Billy is alternating the bass notes by moving his left middle finger to the F# (2nd fret of low E string), on the longer measures at least – which I note as B7/F#.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-importance-of-bass-notes-in-the-the-em-df-g">The importance of bass notes in the the Em-D/F#-G</h3>

<p>Whether strumming or playing fingerstyle, I always prefer playing these 3 chords by (1) first plucking the bass note – and then (2) plucking the thinnest 3-4 strings. This is tremendously helpful when it comes to capturing the sound heard in the Billy Strings version, as well as that of Doc Watson etc.</p>
