<h2 id="editors-notes">Editorâ€™s notes</h2>

<p>Hey there friends! Hereâ€™s my lesson for the Dire Straits song â€œRomeo &amp; Julietâ€. Iâ€™ll be showing you an â€œeasyâ€ way to pick up your guitar and play this song, specifically (1) using no capo, (2) in standard tuning, and (3) using a simplified version of the intro. All this together allows you to quickly jump into the song, hopefully keeping things accessible. As per normal, Iâ€™ll explain the chord shapes, the verse &amp; chorus progressions, talk about strumming, and then break down the intro riff step-by-step.</p>

<p>Best of luck with things! Again, keep on reading for additional notes on how to play this 100% exactly like Dire Straits does. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy this lesson and the PDF chord sheet Iâ€™ve made for this song.</p>

<h2 id="capo-and-tuning">Capo and tuning</h2>

<p>My video is in standard tuning, no capo â€“â€“ which aims to give you an accessible way to play this song with any oleâ€™ guitar. However, if you want to play along with Dire Straits, use the chords I show and put a capo on the 3rd fret. Any for extra credit even, youâ€™ll want to tune your guitar to open G tuning (D G D G B D). Check out Justin Sandercoeâ€™s lesson if you want to learn how to play it in open G. Again, my lesson is a simple version (standard tuning, no capo).</p>

<h2 id="chords">Chords</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s how to play the 4 chords youâ€™ll need in this song. Standard D-G-A, with a barre chord B-minor in the mix.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“
B â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“
G â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“4â€“â€“â€“
D â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“4â€“â€“â€“
A â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“
E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
     D   G   A   Bm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A hint about the A-major and the B-minor chord, which are probably the trickiest chords to switch between. The trick being: get used to playing the A-major by barring the 2nd 3rd and 4th strings with your index finger (donâ€™t play the thinnest string). This sets your index finger up for the barre position youâ€™ll need to play the B-minor chord.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“                               E â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“  &lt;== barred index finger
B â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“ &lt;== barred index finger       B â€“â€“â€“3â€“â€“â€“  &lt;== left middle
G â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“ &lt;== barred index finger       G â€“â€“â€“4â€“â€“â€“  &lt;== left pinky
D â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“ &lt;== barred index finger       D â€“â€“â€“4â€“â€“â€“  &lt;== left ring
A â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“                               A â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“  &lt;== barred index finger
E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“                               E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“
     A                                       Bm
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="chord-progressions">Chord progressions</h2>

<p>A quick note about the chord progressions. The following is a rough outline. Sometimes, such as in the first verse, certain chords (e.g., the A-major in the 1st measure of the verse) isnâ€™t heard at all. Other chords (e.g., the G in the 5th measure of the verse) actually come on the â€œ+â€ count after the â€œ4â€ â€“ but I have them on the quarter note below. Again, my aim with this lesson is to give you the general outline, and not the ultra-specific matching <em>exactly</em> what Dire Straits plays in all cases. To do the latter would add unnecessary difficulty, and not be required for those astute musicians among you who â€œhearâ€ the nuance anyway.</p>

<p>Verse:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>D           A   Bm          A   D           A   Bm      G
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

A           G   A       D       G               A
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>D       A       Bm      G       D       A       Bm      G   A
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

D       G       Bm      G       Em              G       Bm  A   D
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Adv. ending to the chorus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"When you gonna realize..."
Em                  /F# G       /A  Bm    A     D
1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="learning-a-simplified-version-of-the-intro">Learning a simplified version of the intro</h2>

<p>Note, Iâ€™m playing this with my fingers (no pick). You can use a pick if you want, but I find the sound to be a bit too precise for the sound of this song, compared to the album version. For all chords in the intro, Iâ€™ll generally use these right-hand fingers to fingerpick the chords. This helps keep right-hand fingers from needing to switch strings, which adds difficulty. If this doesnâ€™t work for you, surely try something else! This is just what I prefer.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“  &lt;= right ring
B â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“  &lt;= right middle
G â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“  &lt;= right index
D â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“  &lt;= right thumb
A â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“  &lt;= right thumb      ...right thumb plays whatever is the thickest
E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“  &lt;= right thumb         string of the chord being played.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, I recommend getting comfortable with these chord shapes played in this timing (play through it a bunch!) â€“ this makes it much easier when you add the connecting flourish notes later. Note Iâ€™m using an A7 chord (instead of A-major) which is easier to switch to, since it only uses 2 left-hand fingers instead of 3. Also, note youâ€™ll need your left pinky on the 3rd fret of the G â€“ this one may be tricky at first.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ see figure 1 of my PDF chord sheet ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, add these flourish notes between the main chord shapes. The advice I have here is to take things slowly, practicing one phrase at a time until youâ€™re comfortable. Then, begin to combine the phrases one at a time. Do this until you can play through the whole thing, slowly at first. Then pickup the speed and work on playing clean notes, adding dynamic expression, etc.</p>
