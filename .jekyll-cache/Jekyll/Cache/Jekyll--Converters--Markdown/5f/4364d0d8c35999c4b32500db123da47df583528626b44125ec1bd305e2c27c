<h2 id="editors-notes">Editorâ€™s notes</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s my lesson on how to play â€œCalifornia Dreaminâ€™â€ in the style of Jose Feliciano, whose version can be heard in Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s film â€œOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood.â€ Make no mistake, what Jose plays is tough â€“Â so Iâ€™ll show you how I went about simplifying it in order to make it more accessible. In the end, youâ€™ll be left with a 4-5 chord groove that you can play in the advance style (like Jose) or in the simplified style (as I play it). Chords, tabs, with finger position pictures â€“ are all included in my PDF. Check it out, and enjoy!</p>
