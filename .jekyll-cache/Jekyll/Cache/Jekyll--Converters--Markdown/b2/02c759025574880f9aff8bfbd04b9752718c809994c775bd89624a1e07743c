<p>In this lesson I‚Äôll show you how to play an acoustic fingerstyle intro to ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve Got a Friend in Me‚Äù, the classic song from the Toy Story movies. This particular arrangement is taken from the YouTube cover of this song by Claire Ryann and her dad, who plays this beautifully and makes it look easy. It‚Äôs only 4 measures, but I‚Äôll break it down for you step by step: the left hand chord shapes, the right hand fingerstyle technique, and also show some opportunities to add some advanced rhythm flourish.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
If you've got troubles
I've got 'em too
There isn't anything, I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and can see it through
'Cause you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me

Some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you
The way I do, it's me and you
Boy, and as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
