<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor‚Äôs notes</h2>

<p>In this lesson, I‚Äôm excited to demonstrate how all of the guitar chord shapes you already know can be used on a ukulele - allowing you to play many of the songs you already know. I‚Äôll explain how this is the case, how to translate 6-string chords on to a 4-string instrument, and talk about some of the differences in pitch you‚Äôll need to understand. If nothing else, I want you to realize that applying your guitar skills to a ukulele is something that‚Äôs likely much easier than you ever thought it would be.</p>

<h2 id="chords-by-shape">Chords by shape</h2>

<p>Each chord shape can be used on both instruments (play the thinnest four strings of any guitar chord on the ukulele). You can play any progression of chord ‚Äúshapes‚Äù you know on guitar on a ukulele - and they‚Äôll sound great (though be in a different pitch than the guitar).</p>

<h2 id="chords-by-sound">Chords by sound</h2>

<p>Each chord uses different shapes on guitar vs. ukulele. This requires you to disassociate the shape from the name - since the same shape on guitar makes a different sound on a ukulele.</p>

<h2 id="common-chord-progressions">Common chord progressions</h2>

<p>Every key has a I-IV-V (one-four-five) progression, and that progression always sounds pleasing ‚Äì¬†no matter the key. Here are some of those progressions in some of the more common keys, showing both the ukulele and guitar chord shapes needed. Notice how relationship of the chord shapes remains similar between both instruments.</p>
