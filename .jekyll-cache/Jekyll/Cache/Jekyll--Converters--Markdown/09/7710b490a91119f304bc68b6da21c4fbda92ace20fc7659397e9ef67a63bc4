<p>Hey friends! Todayâ€™s lesson is for a short 5-measure riff with an old-timey, jangly sound â€“ using a guitar technique very much evocative of the â€œCarter Scratchâ€ style of play, which combines rhythm and lead at the same time. Thereâ€™s also heavy use of the stretched pinky finger to add flourish notes to a D-major chord, which is something I first taught in lesson #167.</p>

<p>The song this riff comes from is â€œIn Dreamsâ€ by Sierra Ferrell, a young up-and-coming country/folk/Americana artist who I learned about through the excellent GemsOnVHS YouTube channel (which travels around, capturing live folk performances off-the-beaten-path). I canâ€™t recommend that particular channel enough, and I look forward to Sierra Ferrellâ€™s upcoming album.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a nice video that NPR Music put out, featuring artist Courtney Marie Andrews explaining &amp; demonstrating the Carter Scratch technique. The production of this video, along with her explanation, are super helpful!</p>
