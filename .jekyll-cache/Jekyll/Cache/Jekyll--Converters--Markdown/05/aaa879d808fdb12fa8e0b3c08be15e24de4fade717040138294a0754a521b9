<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>Here’s a guitar lesson showing you how to play “You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go” by Bob Dylan (in standard tuning). This is a great song from the album “Blood on the Tracks,” which I love love love. As I note in the lesson, this is likely not how Bob Dylan played (plays) the song – it’s unique arrangement I pieced together myself – so take it for what it’s worth. This lesson includes chords, tabs, and strumming pattern – with a nice focus on how to emphasize the bass note of each chord as part of the strumming pattern.</p>

<p>As I note in my video lesson, there’s a few caveats of note here. Whenever I play the E-major chord that precedes an E-major-7, I’ll only play the highest 4 strings – which lets the walk-down in the bass note be heard much more prominently. Also, my A-major is technically an Asus2 chord – play whichever you like. Likewise, I’m doing a modified (easier) B where the highest two strings are left open. You can replace this with a normal B-major, if you like, obviously.</p>

<h4 id="refrain-chords">Refrain chords</h4>

<p>I’m playing an Aadd6 for the “A6” chord I note below. You could also make that a F#-minor if you want. I’m playing the A-major and B-major the same way I play them in the verse, but again – play them like normal if you prefer.</p>

<h2 id="basic-strumming-pattern">Basic strumming pattern</h2>

<p>The basic pattern I use is as follows. This reads “Down, down… up-down-up” if you were to speak it out loud. I’ll show you some ways to add some nuance to this next, but this core pattern by itself I find helpful to start with.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>D = downstrum
U = upstrum

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D   D     U D U
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="strumming-with-bass-note-emphasis">Strumming with bass-note emphasis</h2>

<h4 id="strumming-pattern-basics">Strumming pattern basics</h4>

<p>For a more advanced strumming pattern, I like to use the following approach – where each chord’s bass note is picked once at the beginning of each strum sequence. The bass down-strum is indicated by the “B” below:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>B = downstrum, bass note only
D = downstrum, all strings of the chord
U = upstrum
&gt; = accented strum

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
B   D     U D U
    &gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Which when repeated in sequence looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
B   D     U D U B   D     U D U B   D     U D U B   D     U D U
    &gt;               &gt;               &gt;               &gt;

<p>And so on.</p>

<h2 id="advanced-bass-note-emphasis">Advanced bass-note emphasis</h2>

<p>Finally, here’s a way to use the bass-note emphasis while periodically alternating bass notes on the chords that you stay on for more than one measure. This adds difficulty, but is quite fun to practice &amp; play – and I think sounds great.</p>
