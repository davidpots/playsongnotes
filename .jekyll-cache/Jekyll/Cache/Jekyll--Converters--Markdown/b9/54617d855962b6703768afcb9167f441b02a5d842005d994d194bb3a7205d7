       F        C         G
Do you remember...... the 28th night
      F       C                G
Of September......... love was changin' the minds
      F        C         G                     F    C     G
Of pretenders........ or chasing the clouds away

                F        C           G
Our hearts were ringing...... in the key that our souls
     F          C                   G
Were singing................. as we danced in the night
  F             C                     G                        F  C  G
Remember..................... how the stars stole the night away

    (no chord)
    Ah ah ah...

    F      C       G
    Ahhhhh-------- say that you remember
    F      C       G
    Ahhhhh-------- dancing in September
    F      C       G
    Ahhhhh-------- never was a cloudy day


My thoughts are with you...... holding hands with your heart
To see you.................... only blue talk and love
Remember...................... how we knew love was here to stay

Now, December..... found the love that we shared
In September...... only blue talk and love
Rremember......... the love that we share today

		Ahhhhh-------- say that you remember
		Ahhhhh-------- dancing in September
		Ahhhhh-------- never was a cloudy day

		Ahhhhh-------- say that you remember
		Ahhhhh-------- dancing in September
		Ahhhhh-------- golden dreams were shiny days

Do you remember... the 28th night of September

		Ahhhhh-------- say that you remember
		Ahhhhh-------- dancing in September
		Ahhhhh-------- never was a cloudy day

		Ahhhhh-------- say that you remember
		Ahhhhh-------- dancing in September
		Ahhhhh-------- golden dreams were shiny days

		There never was a cloudy day
