<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor‚Äôs notes</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs a quick lesson for the CCR song ‚ÄúLookin‚Äô Out My Back Door‚Äù ‚Äì¬†performed fingerstyle with no capo. This is what I‚Äôd call an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù or ‚Äúlazy‚Äù approach to this song, where I‚Äôm taking a very accessible route when it comes to the capo (not using one), fingerpicking (using an easy pattern), and key change (not bothering withit here). While not the stuff of virtuosos, this approach makes for a good campfire take on the song - which sometimes is all you need to feel the musical goodness.</p>

<p>I plan on eventually tackling a more thorough lesson of this song (complete with muted strumming, chord changes, a few guitar licks, etc) ‚Äì but that will be for another day.</p>

<h3 id="standard-tuning-capo-1st-fret">Standard Tuning, Capo 1st Fret</h3>

<p>This tab shows how to play this song using a capo (positioned on the 1st fret) in standard tuning. You only need to apply a capo (and play in the key of A major) if you want to play along with the album version. Otherwise, a capo is not required. Also, let me disclaim that I‚Äôm aware CCR may have played this song without a capo, starting in the key of Bb. If you‚Äôre looking for the exact tab to play in Bb, seek elsewhere. I‚Äôm primarily concerned with creating a tab that is accessible to the masses (and playing in the key of A is certainly easier than that of Bb).</p>

<h3 id="guitar-chords-used">Guitar Chords Used</h3>

<p>Here is how to play the guitar used in this song. First, the chords used in the key of A:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e-|---0----2----2---0----
B-|---2----2----3---0----
G-|---2----2----2---1----
D-|---2----4----0---2----
A-|---0----4--------2----
E-|--------2--------0----
      A   F#m   D   E
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After changing key to B, you‚Äôll want to use these chords:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e-|--------4----0----2----
B-|---4----4----0----2----
G-|---4----4----1----3----
D-|---4----6----2----4----
A-|---2----6----2----4----
E-|--------4----0----2----
      B   G#m   E    F#
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="note-the-change-in-key">Note the Change in Key</h3>

<p>Late in the song, note that the song modulates (changes key) up one whole step. Using the chords shown above, you‚Äôll notice the change is from the key of A to the key of B. All chord progressions stay the same, as far as each chord‚Äôs relative position to the root. Ultimately, this change in key is by no means required when playing the song ‚Äì but I wanted to make note of this for those interested in a faithful adaptation.</p>
