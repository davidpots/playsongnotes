<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Barefoot, she smiled... leapt without looking
And tumbled into----- the Seine
The water was freezing, she spent a month sneezing
But said she would do it  again

    Here's to the ones who dream
    Foolish as they may seem
    Here's to the hearts that ache
    Here's to the mess we make

She captured a feeling, sky with no ceiling
The sunset inside a frame
She lived in her liquor, and died with a flicker
I'll always remember the flame

    Here's to the ones who dream
    Foolish as they may seem
    Here's to the hearts that ache
    Here's to the mess we make

        She told me...
        A bit of madness is key
        To give us new colors to see
        Who knows where it will lead us?
        And that's why they need us

So bring on the rebels, the ripples from pebbles
The painters, and poets, and plays

    And here's to the fools who dream
    Crazy as they may seem
    Here's to the hearts that break
    Here's to the mess we make

            I trace it all back to then
            Her, and the snow, and the Seine
            Smiling through it
            She said she'd do it again
</code></pre></div></div>
