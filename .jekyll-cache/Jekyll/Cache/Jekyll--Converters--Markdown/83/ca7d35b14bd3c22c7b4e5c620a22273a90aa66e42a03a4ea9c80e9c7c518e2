<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor‚Äôs notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends! Here‚Äôs a new lesson where I‚Äôll show you a Tyler Childers-inspired arrangement of Green Day‚Äôs 1990s classic Welcome to Paradise (via their album ‚ÄúDookie‚Äù). This one takes the raw, backwoods-style acoustic country sound (of Tyler Childers, but also artists like Steve Earle via Copperhead Road) and imagines how that type of guitar playing might be applied to a pop-punk song. The result is what‚Äôs in this lesson, and I hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>From a guitar POV, the heart of this arrangement is based on a D-riff (which can be played in Drop-D tuning), similar to that used in Tyler Childers‚Äô Feathered Indians and Whitehouse Road ‚Äì and also Steve Earle‚Äôs Copperhead Road. This results in a droning, raw sound (lots of open D-string) with occasional flourish via reaching your pinky. I also use an occasional A-riff (via hammering-on the 5th string) for added acoustic flourish. I show it all in my video lesson, with tabs!</p>

<p>Timestamps for this video:</p>

<p>Again, note this is all one whole-step lower than one Green Day plays. I‚Äôm playing it in this key because it fits the country arrangement I‚Äôm doing better. See my video for more context here.</p>
