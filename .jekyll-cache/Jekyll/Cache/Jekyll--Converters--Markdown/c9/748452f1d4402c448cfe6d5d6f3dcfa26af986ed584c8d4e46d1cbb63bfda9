<p>Hey friends! Here‚Äôs a quick exercise to help you practice your left-pinky pull-off technique. By pull-off, I‚Äôm referring to the opposite of a hammer-on‚Ä¶ where a finger is forcefully pulled ‚Äúoff‚Äù of a fretted string, such that it sounds like the string is being plucked.</p>

<p>Specially, we‚Äôll be doing these three transitions ‚Äì‚Äì¬†where the left pinky (highlighted) is initial positioned on the 3rd fret‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img src="/images/lessons/304-chord-1.jpg" /></p>

<p>But then, after the pinky is pulled off, it‚Äôs the red note shown below that will sound out, as if it was plucked.</p>

<p>This is a great way to add flourish to any riff in a way that‚Äôs done entirely with the left hand. This riff in particular includes a few of the most common pull-off scenarios beginner guitarists will encounter.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a preview of the full PDF (attached at the bottom of this post):</p>

<p>Thanks to supporter Erik for sending in the song I based this lesson off of (Chillin in the Backwoods by Jawga Boys). While I didn‚Äôt know the song, this intro riff caught my ear at once ‚Äì‚Äì and I knew it‚Äôd make for a good lesson showing this technique.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd eventually love to do some more focused lessons on the hammer-on and pull-off techniques with a very technical focus ‚Äì but until then, I trust this exercise might be a good one to try out.</p>

<p>Thanks and until next time ‚úåÔ∏è</p>
