<p>Hey friends! Here’s a quick exercise to help you practice your left-pinky pull-off technique. By pull-off, I’m referring to the opposite of a hammer-on… where a finger is forcefully pulled “off” of a fretted string, such that it sounds like the string is being plucked.</p>

<p>Specially, we’ll be doing these three transitions –– where the left pinky (highlighted) is initial positioned on the 3rd fret…</p>

<p>But then, after the pinky is pulled off, it’s the red note shown below that will sound out, as if it was plucked.</p>

<p>This is a great way to add flourish to any riff in a way that’s done entirely with the left hand. This riff in particular includes a few of the most common pull-off scenarios beginner guitarists will encounter.</p>

<p>Here’s a preview of the full PDF (attached at the bottom of this post):</p>

<p>Thanks to supporter Erik for sending in the song I based this lesson off of (Chillin in the Backwoods by Jawga Boys). While I didn’t know the song, this intro riff caught my ear at once –– and I knew it’d make for a good lesson showing this technique.</p>

<p>I’d eventually love to do some more focused lessons on the hammer-on and pull-off techniques with a very technical focus – but until then, I trust this exercise might be a good one to try out.</p>

<p>Thanks and until next time ✌️</p>
