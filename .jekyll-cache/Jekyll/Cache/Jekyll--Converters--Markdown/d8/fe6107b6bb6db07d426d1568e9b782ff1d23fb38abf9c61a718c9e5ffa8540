<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends! Here’s a brand new lesson showing you an acoustic version of Cheap Trick’s 1978 classic “Surrender”. In this tutorial, I’ll show you a slightly simplified version of this tune, arranged to work well on a solo acoustic guitar. While the spirit of this song is retained in this version, I’ll cut a few small corners – mainly, changing the key so we’ll be using more typical acoustic chords (key of C, and then key of D in the final verse).</p>

<p>Aside from the usual chord shapes, progressions, and strumming tips – I’ll also show you a full tab for the verse &amp; chorus sections, allowing you to play the notes matching the vocal melody while simultaneously strumming the chords. Whether you want to noodle on this, or combine it while singing &amp; fully strumming – the tabs I provide in my PDF will give you what you need. This is one of my favorite rock songs ever… I hope you enjoy the lesson!</p>

<p>As stated above and below, this arrangement takes a few small liberties (changing the key, modifying the intro chords, etc) to make this better suited for a more beginner-friendly acoustic version. Take what you like, leave the rest. See my video lesson for reference and how this sounds when played.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-arrangement">About this arrangement</h2>

<p>Of course, this arrangement takes some liberties and is slightly different from the original song in a few ways. Big picture, I’m changing things to the key of C which lets us use easier chords… and also allows us to modulate up one whole step to the key of D for the final verse &amp; chorus. Also, I’m using different voicings for the chords heard in the intro and between each verse… which again is in the name of making things a bit simpler for a basic acoustic version.</p>

<p>This song is played at 134 BPM, with four beats per measure. The chord progressions for each section are shown here below, in both the key of C and the key of D (used in the final verse &amp; chorus).</p>

<h2 id="video-of-cheap-tricks-version-of-surrender">Video of Cheap Trick’s version of Surrender</h2>

<p>While my arrangement above is in a different key, this may be still helpful to listen to for context. Quick tip: you can play along with verse #3 of this official version using the “key of C” progression I show above… because Cheap Trick modulates up to the key of C for the final verse (they’re in the key of B for verses 1+2).</p>
