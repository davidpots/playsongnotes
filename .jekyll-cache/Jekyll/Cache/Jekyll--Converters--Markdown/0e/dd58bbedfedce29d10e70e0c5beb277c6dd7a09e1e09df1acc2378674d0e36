<p>Hey friends! Here’s a guitar lesson for the recent hit “Memories” by Maroon 5. I’ll be focusing specifically on teaching an approachable, easy strum-along version of this song, as opposed to teaching you the precise tab used by Maroon 5’s guitarist. The aim here is to turn this into something you pick up and play, in a casual / campfire / laid back sense. I’ll explain the chords, teach you the chord progress, and most important dig into the rhythm (“pushing” the 2nd chord of each measure). In the back half I’ll dive into some more advanced stuff, looking at a more fleshed out strumming pattern as well as adding percussive hits on beat 2 and 4. I’ll be using a capo on the 4th fret.</p>

<p>Here’s what I teach in this lesson:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0:00 Lesson overview</li>
  <li>1:10 Chord shapes needed</li>
  <li>2:55 Chord progression w/ simple strum</li>
  <li>5:38 Advanced strumming options</li>
  <li>8:48 Misc tips &amp; farewell</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s the official version of the song, if you want to listen or play along… which I recommend! Remember, add a capo to the 4th fret using the chords I show to play along.</p>
