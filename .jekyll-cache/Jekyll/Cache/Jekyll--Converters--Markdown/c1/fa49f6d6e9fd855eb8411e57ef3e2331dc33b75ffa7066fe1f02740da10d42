<h2>No PDF chord sheet exists for this lesson</h2>

<p>As of now, I haven't made a printable PDF to accompany this video lesson. If you'd like to request that I make one, <a href="mailto:play.songnotes@gmail.com?subject=PDF Request for 'Santeria'">shoot me an email</a>. I can't guarantee I'll make a PDF for every older lesson, but it's helpful to know which lessons have the most interest.</p>

<p>In this lesson I‚Äôll show you how I like to play a strummed, solo acoustic version of ‚ÄúSanteria‚Äù by Sublime (from their 1996 self-titled album). While originally played in the key of E, I‚Äôll be playing in the key of C ‚Äì which lets you utilize more traditional open chords. This makes it easier to play, as well as lending itself very nicely for the laid back acoustic vibe I‚Äôm going for with this arrangement. Add a capo 4th fret, and you‚Äôll be able to play along with the Sublime version.</p>

<h2 id="capo-4-to-play-along-with-the-album-version">Capo 4 to play along with the album version</h2>

<p>Heads up! I like to play this song in the key of C, which means you‚Äôll need a capo on the 4th fret in order to play with Sublime‚Äôs album version (which is in the key of E). I prefer the key of C because it lets you use more typical open chords, which works nicely for a chilled out acoustic version of this song.</p>

<h2 id="chord-shapes-needed">Chord shapes needed</h2>

<p>If played in the key of C, here‚Äôs the chords you‚Äôll need. The trickiest one here is the F ‚Äì which I‚Äôll often play by only fretting the middle 4 strings (e.g., x3321x) ‚Äì keeping the thinnest and thickest strings muted. This is easier than a barre chord F, but you can use that if you want.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ See PDF for chord shape diagrams ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="chord-progressions">Chord Progressions</h2>

<p>If you play four beats per measure, using a tempo of 175bpm, the chord progression looks as follows. You could also use a 50% slower tempo (i.e. around 90bpm) but that requires you to strum along on 16th notes, which is trickier to explain. See my video lesson for details.</p>

<p>Verse (play twice):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>| C  . . . | C  . . . | E . . . | E . . . |
| Am . . . | Am . . . | G . . . | G . . . |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>| F . . . | G . . . | C . . . | Am . . . | x3
| F . . . | G . . . |                      x1
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming pattern</h2>

<p>I prefer either of the following patterns for an acoustic version. One of them is doing all down strums on the quarter notes, with the ‚Äú1‚Äù and ‚Äú3‚Äù counts getting only the bass notes, and the ‚Äú2‚Äù and ‚Äú4‚Äù getting accents/emphasis. Or, you could do the more full strum I show ‚Äì which requires a bit more of the right hand but sounds good I think.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="faking-the-first-line-of-the-solo">Faking the first line of the solo</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs the tab for the first 2 chords of the solo, if your goal is to mimic the notes being played in Sublime‚Äôs album version (which again, is in the key of E). This is just a fun, fairly do-able way to approximate the recognizable sound and maybe turn a few heads. For the remaining chords (Am-G), I don‚Äôt have the rest of the solo tab worked out ‚Äì so I‚Äôll just noodle around on those.</p>
