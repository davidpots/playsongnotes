<p>Hello my friends! In this lesson I‚Äôll be showing you how to play ‚ÄúHave You Ever Seen the Rain‚Äù by Creedence Clearwater Revival. This is one of the first songs I played at open mic nights back when I was getting confidence with my guitar skills - and it‚Äôs been a blast to pick it back up again. I‚Äôll teach you the basics, as well as plenty of intermediate and advanced stuff (double strumming, percussive strum pattern, chorus walkdown, etc). As always, I sincerely hope you find this helpful in learning this fun tune.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs my timestamps for this lesson:</p>

<p>Of the countless covers of this song, the most recent one I heard that caught my ear was from Callista Clark, who combines an absolutely killer voice with a very authentic (and literal) front porch vibe.</p>

    Someone told me long ago... there‚Äôs a calm before the storm
      G                           C
    I know... and its been coming for some time
    C
    ...When its over so they say... it‚Äôll rain a sunny day

    ...Yesterday and days before... sun is cold and rain is hot
        G                       C
    I know... been that way for all my time
    C
    ‚ÄòTill forever on it goes... through the circle fast and slow
        G                         C
    I know... and I can‚Äôt stop, I wonder
