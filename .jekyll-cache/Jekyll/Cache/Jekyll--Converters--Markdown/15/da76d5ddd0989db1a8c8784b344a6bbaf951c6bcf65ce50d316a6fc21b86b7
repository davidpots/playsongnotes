<p>Hey friends! Hereâ€™s new a video lesson &amp; PDF chord sheet teaching you how to play the recent country hit 7 Summers by Morgan Wallen. Musically, this song makes some good use of major-7th chords (with the Cmaj7 and Fmaj7 in the intro and verse), mixed in with Wallenâ€™s clever word-play and great vocals. Iâ€™ll show you the chord shapes, progressions, strumming patterns, and a few ways to noodle on the intro (with tabs), in a way that sounds great with a solo acoustic guitar.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t know Morgan Wallen, I strongly recommend checking out his stuff â€“ specifically via Grady Smithâ€™s YouTube videos, which do a good job introducing you the general vibe of his music. This includes some good commentary on Wallenâ€™s cover of Jason Isbellâ€™s Cover Me Up, which Isbell praised him for. Hereâ€™s one of Grady Smithâ€™s videos on Wallen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_mcQHU_GyY</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a few ways I like to play the intro riff! For the Cmaj7, I know others teach it further up the next, but I like the practical versions shown here. For the Fmaj7, Iâ€™ve included two filler riffs which you can optionally during those two measures (see my video lesson for reference).</p>
