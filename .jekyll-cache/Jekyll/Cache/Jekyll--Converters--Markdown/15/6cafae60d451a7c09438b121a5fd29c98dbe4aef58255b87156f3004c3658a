<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends! Here’s a new lesson where I’ll show you a Tyler Childers-inspired arrangement of Green Day’s 1990s classic Welcome to Paradise (via their album “Dookie”). This one takes the raw, backwoods-style acoustic country sound (of Tyler Childers, but also artists like Steve Earle via Copperhead Road) and imagines how that type of guitar playing might be applied to a pop-punk song. The result is what’s in this lesson, and I hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>From a guitar POV, the heart of this arrangement is based on a D-riff (which can be played in Drop-D tuning), similar to that used in Tyler Childers’ Feathered Indians and Whitehouse Road – and also Steve Earle’s Copperhead Road. This results in a droning, raw sound (lots of open D-string) with occasional flourish via reaching your pinky. I also use an occasional A-riff (via hammering-on the 5th string) for added acoustic flourish. I show it all in my video lesson, with tabs!</p>

<p>If you dig this style of playing, here’s related lessons I’ve made – all of these being in the key of D and having a similar outlaw country-ish sound. PDFs for each of these are available via the links below:</p>

<p>Again, note this is all one whole-step lower than one Green Day plays. I’m playing it in this key because it fits the country arrangement I’m doing better. See my video for more context here.</p>
