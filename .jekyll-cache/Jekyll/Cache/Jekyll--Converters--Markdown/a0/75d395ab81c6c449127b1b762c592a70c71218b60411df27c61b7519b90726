<p>Hey friends! Hereâ€™s a tip &amp; technique video, with a companion PDF chord sheet, showing you how to approach the F-major chord with a wrapped thumb on the low E string. Specifically, Iâ€™ll be talking about how this technique is helpful when playing fingerstyle - when youâ€™ll often want your left pinky free to add flourish notes on the thinnest couple strings. Iâ€™ll walk you through the technique, starting simple and guiding you through the process. Iâ€™ll even show you a few practice exercises to put this technique through the paces. I hope you enjoy!</p>
