<h2 id="editors-notes">Editorâ€™s notes</h2>

<p>Hey friends - hereâ€™s a guitar melody exercise, using the 1961 Elvis classic Canâ€™t Help Falling in Love. Specifically, Iâ€™ll go measure-by-measure through the verse, and for each chord Iâ€™ll figure out what exact melody note Elvis is singing. This is an incredibly helpful skill to have. My hope is, by seeing me go through this in real time, youâ€™ll glean a hint into the process of determining melody notes. In addition to my video, Iâ€™ve created 1-page PDF showing you the 16 measures of the verse, with the melody notes highlighted for you to play.</p>
