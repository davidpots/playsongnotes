<p>Here’s my lesson on how to play “California Dreamin’” in the style of Jose Feliciano, whose version can be heard in Quentin Tarantino’s film “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” Make no mistake, what Jose plays is tough – so I’ll show you how I went about simplifying it in order to make it more accessible. In the end, you’ll be left with a 4-5 chord groove that you can play in the advance style (like Jose) or in the simplified style (as I play it). Chords, tabs, with finger position pictures – are all included in my PDF. Check it out, and enjoy!</p>
