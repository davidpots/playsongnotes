<p>In this lesson weâ€™re going to have some fun with D-Cadd9-G â€“â€“ specifically, by applying the same 3-note riff to the high-E string of all of the chords. While this approach ups the difficulty with finger positioning, it results in something that sounds great. Led Zeppelinâ€™s â€œThank Youâ€ and Marshall Tucker Bandâ€™s â€œCanâ€™t You Seeâ€ both use a very similar approach to the D-Cadd9-G chords, and this lesson will help get you familiar with some techniques needed to play those songs. I hope you enjoy!</p>
