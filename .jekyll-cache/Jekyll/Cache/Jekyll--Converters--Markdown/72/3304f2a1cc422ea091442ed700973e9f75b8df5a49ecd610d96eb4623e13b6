<p>Hey friends - hereâ€™s a guitar lesson teaching you how to play Mr. Bojangles, originally written and released by Jerry Jeff Walker in 1968. This tutorial will give you the chords, strumming patterns, and chord progressions that will also work for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Bandâ€™s 1970 cover, if youâ€™re more familiar with that one. This song is in the key of C, and uses a very common descending bass-note walkdown in 3/4 time. Nothing too complicated â€“ but even for the more difficult chords (F and D7/F#), Iâ€™ll show you some hints to simplify things. I hope you enjoy!</p>
