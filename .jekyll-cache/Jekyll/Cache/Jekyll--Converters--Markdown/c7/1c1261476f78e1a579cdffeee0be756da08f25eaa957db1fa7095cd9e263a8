<p>Hey friends! Quick question &amp; answer video here, where Tim writes in asking about playing without a pick: he says his thumb is doing him just fine – and he’s wondered if he is missing out on anything. In this video I’ll give my thoughts (if it works for you, keep it up!) – and show off 3 basic techniques for strumming without using a pick, should you find yourself curious. To be honest, the last 1-2 years I’ve found myself more and more comfortable strumming without a pick – so I’m quite happy to show you some of my favorite approaches.</p>

<p>Here’s the timestamps so you know what you’re in for.</p>
