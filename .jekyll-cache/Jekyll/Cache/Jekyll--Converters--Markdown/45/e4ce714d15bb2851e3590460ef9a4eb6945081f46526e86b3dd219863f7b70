<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor‚Äôs notes</h2>

<p>In this lesson I‚Äôll show you a fun fingerstyle exercise based on a C-major walkdown progression. Using 2 different arrangements, I‚Äôll teach how you can use common chords in the key of C to capture the sound of a descending bass line throughout an 8-measure progression. This is inspired by the guitar work heard in Taylor Swift‚Äôs song ‚ÄúDeath by 1000 Cuts‚Äù ‚Äì though you‚Äôll need a capo 4th fret to play along with her song (using the tabs I show).</p>

<p>‚ÄúDeath by Thousand Cuts‚Äù by Taylor Swift. Again, you‚Äôll need to add a capo on the 4th fret to play along with her version. The guitar starts 11 seconds in.</p>
