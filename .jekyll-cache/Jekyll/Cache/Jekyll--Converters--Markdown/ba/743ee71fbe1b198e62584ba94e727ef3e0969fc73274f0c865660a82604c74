<p>In this lesson Iâ€™ll teach you how to play a solo acoustic version of â€œMaybe Itâ€™s Time,â€ as heard in the 2018 version of the film â€œA Star is Bornâ€. This is a song that only needs 3-4 common chords, which can either be strummed or played via fingerpicking. Thereâ€™s one tricky part of the song, which involves walking down from G to D/F# to E-minor â€“ which Iâ€™ll show you how to tackle in two different ways. I hope you find this helpful, check out my lesson for â€œShallowâ€ also from this movie.</p>

<h2 id="walking-down-from-g-to-em">Walking down from G to Em</h2>

<p>In both the verse and the chorus, thereâ€™s a distinctive walk-down that can be heard (from G to D/F# to E-minor). Hereâ€™s two different ways to play it. When I do a D/F#, I either focus on the bottom four strings (2002xx) â€“ or Iâ€™ll just keep the G shape with my pinky, but add the F# bass note (2nd fret of the low E string). They both sound good, in my opinion.</p>

<h2 id="chord-progression-cheat-sheet">Chord progression cheat sheet:</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s a birdâ€™s eye view of the chord progressions used in this song (i.e., for the verse and chorus). Theyâ€™re very similar, the only differences being which chords you start &amp; end with - for the most part. Remember, four counts per measure.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Verse:        "Maybe it's time to let the old ways die..."

              | G          | G          | G          | G         |
              | C          | C          | G          | G         |
              | C          | C          | G    D/F#  | Em        |
              | D          | C          | G          | G         |


Chorus:       "I'm glad I can't go back to where I came from..."

              | C          | C          | G          | G         |
              | C          | C          | G          | G         |

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming pattern</h2>

<p>The main idea with the strumming pattern, no matter which one you choose to employ, is to try to accent the 2 and the 4 counts. Even if you do simple down-strums on all 4 counts, try to give a little oomph to the 2 and the 4 (or alternatively, ease up on the 1 and the 3).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Simple strum:     1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
                  D   D   D   D
                      &gt;       &gt;

Full strum #1:    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
                  D   D   D U D U
                      &gt;       &gt;

Full strum #2:    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
                  D   D U   U D U
