<p>Hey friends ‚Äì here‚Äôs a quick lesson for playing ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù in an arrangement that leans heavily into triad chord shapes (mainly on the thinnest 3-4 strings). Chord-wise this mostly uses G and D ‚Äì but we‚Äôll be adding and removing certain fingers at various points in order to let the melody of this classic tune shine through with what you‚Äôre playing. And of course, these triads can be used in various circumstances in so many other songs and scenarios ‚Äì so you‚Äôll get a lot out of this one, beyond wishing someone a happy birthday. As always, tabs included in my chord sheet!</p>
