<p>In this lesson Iâ€™ll show you how to play every chord in the key of C using only two fingers (for both right and left hands). For the past decade, this has been a favorite technique to use when I pick up the guitar and simply want to loosely play around. While this technique obviously canâ€™t be used in all scenarios, itâ€™s still a great trick to learn that can be used for warming up, finger strength, improvisation, and even certain songs (such as Blackbird). Iâ€™ll show you tabs for these chords, show a fretboard map, explain the difference in major vs. minor chord shapes, and show a few examples of how to spice it up. I hope you enjoy!</p>
