<p>Hey friends! In this video I answer a question many of you have emailed in: which guitar pick do I use? I’ll answer the question, explaining why I use the pick I’ve favored for the past 10 years or so (<a href="https://amzn.to/3drJIKr">Dunlop .46mm “Delrin” 41P.46, light pink</a>) — and why I’ve settled on this pick after experimenting with a few similar ones over the years.</p>

<p>I recommend buying the pick from a local guitar store. But if that’s not possible, here’s a link to get it from Amazon (purchasing after clicking this link gives a few cents back to me):</p>

<h2 id="why-i-like-this-pick">Why I like this pick</h2>

<p>The two main reasons I like the Dunlop .46mm Delrin style pick:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s flexible enough to create a softer sound on the strings, but not too flimsy as to prevent you from projecting individual strings when necessary. I’ve experimented with picks from Dunlop in both directions – the next thinner version, and the next more stiff version… in both attempts, I felt like I was moving away from the sweet spot that the .46mm provides.</li>
  <li>It’s material has a nice “grip” on my thumb and index finger, which I find much more helpful than nylon when it comes to keeping control of the pick (and not dropping it).</li>
</ol>

<p>In the video I’ll talk through all this and more, with some visual examples and guitar playing demonstrations to accompany some of the points I make. I hope you find this helpful… thanks to all of you who asked this question!</p>
