<h2 id="editors-notes">Editorâ€™s notes</h2>

<p>Ever have trouble getting your fingers crammed together to play the A-major chord? Youâ€™re not alone! Hereâ€™s a simple technique you can use - where a simple tweak of your finger position can create a lot more breathing room for all of your fingers. Not only does this make the chord easier to switch to, but it actually makes certain common transitions (do D-major and E-major) easier than they were before.</p>

<h2 id="the-normal-way-to-play-a-major">The â€œnormalâ€ way to play A-major</h2>

<p>Usually, A-major is taught (and played) like this. Three fingers in a row, all on the 2nd fret. This may well be good enough for you â€“ especially if your fingers arenâ€™t huge, or if youâ€™re playing on a large enough guitar.</p>

<p>However, a challenge with this finger positioning is things can get crammed when your fingers are in a straight line like this. For me, I have very little wiggle room - itâ€™s quite frankly not comfortable. Luckily, there is another wayâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="the-triangle-way-to-play-a-major">The â€œtriangleâ€ way to play A-major</h2>

<p>Here, weâ€™re playing the same notes - but weâ€™re using our left-hand fingers in a different way. Notice how the index finger is in the middle of the 3 notes, instead of on the far side. This creates a triangle shape, which actually allows for much more wiggle room around each finger. The result is a chord thatâ€™s quicker to switch to and more comfortable to play.</p>

<h2 id="easy-transitions-between-a-d-and-e">Easy transitions between A, D, and E</h2>

<p>A straight-up benefit for playing A-major in this manner, is your index finger will be on the same string that itâ€™s used on the D-major and E-major chord - both of which are very frequently played along with the A-major chord. See my video for reference - switching between these three chords is a breeze when your index finger doesnâ€™t have to ever change strings.</p>

G â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“1â€“â€“â€“â€“  &lt;== left index finger is used on this
D â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“      string for all 3 chords (good!)
A â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“2â€“â€“â€“â€“
E â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“0â€“â€“â€“â€“

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, a nice benefit of this chord voicing is that you can still play the common Asus2 and Asus4 chords just as you did before. Meaning, youâ€™re using your left-hand pinky for the Asus4â€™s 3rd fret note - which feels 100% natural.</p>
