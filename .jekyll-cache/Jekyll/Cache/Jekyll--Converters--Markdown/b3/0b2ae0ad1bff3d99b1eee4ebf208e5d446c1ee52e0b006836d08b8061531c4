INTRO
    Am . . . F . . . C . . . G . . .   (x4, with "hey!" on G)

VERSE
    Am           F                      C
    I don't like walking around this old and empty house
    So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear

    The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake
    It's the house telling you to close your eyes

    Some days I can't even dress myself
    It's killing me to see you this way

                          Am        F
        'Cause though the truth may vary, this
        C            G         Am     F          C
        ...Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

CHORUS
            Am   F   C   G
            ............ Hey!
            ............ Hey!
            ............ Hey!

    There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
    Well, tell her that I miss our little talks

    Soon it will all be over, and buried with our past
    We used to play outside when we were young
    ...and full of life and full of love

    Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
    Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear

        'Cause though the truth may vary, this
        Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore (...hey!)

            Don't listen to a word I say   (...hey!)
            The screams all sound the same (...hey!)
            Though the truth may vary, this
            Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

            ............ Hey!
            ............ Hey!

    (quieter)
    You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
    All that's left is a ghost of you

    Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
    Just let me go, we'll meet again soon

    (louder)
    Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
    I'll see you when I fall asleep (...hey!)

            Don't listen to a word I say   (...hey!)
            The screams all sound the same (...hey!)
            Though the truth may vary, this
            Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

            Don't listen to a word I say   (...hey!)
            The screams all sound the same (...hey!)
            Though the truth may vary, this
            Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

            (quieter)
            Though the truth may vary, this
            Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
            Though the truth may vary, this
            Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
