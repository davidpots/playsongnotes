<h2 id="editors-notes">Editor’s notes</h2>

<p>Hey there friends! New video today, where I return to the topic of walk-ups and walk-downs – and explain how add some gritty, raw, twangy-ness to your sound simply by using flat-third (b3) and flat-seventh (b7) notes. Everything I’ve taught you saw far (in related videos) has fully embraced the notes in the major scale… and today we’re going to break out of that box, just a little bit. The overall impact this makes to the vibe of your playing can be understated, but at the same time quite powerful!</p>

  <li>In the first 4 minutes I’ll explain the overall context and lay-of-the-land, playing the same riffs for you in both a “clean” style (only using notes from the major scale), and then a “gritty” style (selectively adding b3 and b7 notes).</li>
  <li>Then, I’ll do a deep dive using the Key of C (4:00) and the Key of D (11:36) – where for each, I’ll use fretboard maps and tabs to walk you through a few examples within each key.</li>
  <li>Finally, I’ll end with some parting advice (15:07)</li>
</ul>
