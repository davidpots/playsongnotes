<h2 id="video-lesson">Video lesson</h2>

<p>I haven‚Äôt made one yet ‚Äì but here‚Äôs a preview of the PDF I made for this song. Note, my PDF is for a strummed verison of this song ‚Äì i.e., it gives you all the chords you need to play along with Colter. It doesn‚Äôt have the fingerstyle tabs, as I haven‚Äôt worked that out yet. I‚Äôd suggest <a href="http://www.banthamlegend.com/Saskatchewan-in-1881/">this lesson</a> if you want to learn it fingerstyle, like Colter plays it.</p>
