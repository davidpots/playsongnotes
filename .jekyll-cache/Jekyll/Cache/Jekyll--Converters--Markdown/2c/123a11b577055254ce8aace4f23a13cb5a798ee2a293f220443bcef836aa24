INTRO
    (no chords, see below for tab)
    Wait 'til you‚Äôre announced
    We‚Äôve not yet lost all our graces
    The hounds will stay in chains

    Look upon your greatness that you'll
    Send the call out, send the call out
    Send the call out, send the call out  
                         (...repeat as desired)

VERSE
    C
    ...Call all the ladies out
    C
    ...They‚Äôre in their finery
    Am
    ...A hundred jewels on throats
    G
    ...A hundred jewels between teeth

    C
    ...Now bring my boys in
    C
    ...Their skin in craters like the moon
    Am
    ...The moon we love like a brother
    G
    ...While he glows through the room

PRE-CHORUS
        C
        Dancing around the lies we tell
        C
        Dancing around big eyes as well
           Am
        Oh-ohhhh... even the comatose
        G (let ring)
        ...They don‚Äôt dance and tell

CHORUS
            F                     Am                             G
            ...We live in cities..... you'll never see on screen
            G                                           Am
            ...Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run free
            F                       Am                          G
            ...Living in the ruins..... of the palace within my dreams
            G                                      F
            ...And you know, we're on each other's team

REFRAIN
                (quiet strumming)
                F              Am
                ...I'm kind of over getting told
                            G
                To throw my hands up in the air... so there

    (normal strumming)
    C
    ...So all the cups got broke
    C
    ...Shards beneath our feet
    Am                          G
    ...But it wasn‚Äôt my fault...

    C
    ...And everyone‚Äôs competing
    C                           Am
    ...For a love they won't receive
    Am                         G (let ring)
    ...'Cause what this palace wants... is release

            F                     Am                             G
            ...We live in cities..... you'll never see on screen
            G                                           Am
            ...Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run free

                F            Am
                ...I‚Äôm kinda older than I was
                         G
                When I reveled without a care... so there

            (normal strumming)

<h2 id="notes-and-tabs">Notes and tabs</h2>

<h3 id="capo-6th-fret-standard-tuning">Capo 6th Fret, Standard Tuning</h3>
<p>If you want to play along with the Lorde album version of this song, you‚Äôll need to put a capo on the 6th fret and use the chords shown here. You can certainly play this song without a capo, but if you use the chords I show here you‚Äôll be in a different key from Lorde‚Äôs version ‚Äì which is fine unless you plan on playing along with her.</p>

<h3 id="guitar-chords-used">Guitar Chords Used</h3>
<p>Here is how to play the guitar chords used in this song. Note, the Lorde recording doesn‚Äôt use a guitar, so I‚Äôm basing these solely off the tonal implications heard in her recording.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e-|---0----3----0----1----
B-|---1----0----1----1----
G-|---0----0----2----2----
D-|---2----0----2----3----
A-|---3----2----0----3----
E-|--------3---------1----
      C    G    Am   F
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming Pattern</h3>
<p>There is a very distinct strumming pattern that works well with this song, which I carefully explain in my video lesson. The trick is to combine your accented strum on the ‚Äú1‚Äù (one) and ‚Äú2+‚Äù (two-and) beats, while adding a percussive slap/chop on the ‚Äú2 and ‚Äú4‚Äù beats. Again, I recommend watching my video lesson to see/hear this in action. Here is a crude text representation of this pattern, showing both components:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>v = strum!
x = muted chop/slap

v        v              v        v             v        v
======================================================================
1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  + 1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +    ...etc
======================================================================
      x           x           x           x          x           x
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="intro-guitar-tab">Intro Guitar Tab</h3>
<p>Here‚Äôs how to play the intro, which Lorde sings over. These notes match the notes she sings. Check out the Juliana cover (below) to see/hear this played with the singing.</p>
