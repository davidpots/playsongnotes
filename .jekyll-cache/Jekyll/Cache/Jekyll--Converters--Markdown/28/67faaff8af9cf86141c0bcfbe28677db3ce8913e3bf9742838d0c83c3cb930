<p>Hey friends! Today we‚Äôre looking at Souvenirs by John Prine, a song so many of you have written in &amp; requested over the past few months. This is a song that‚Äôs brand new to me ‚Äì and in this video I‚Äôm going to show my real-time process of transcribing the 16-measure intro fingerpicking sequence. Specifically, I‚Äôll show how I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Figured out what key the song is in (1:17)</li>
  <li>Figured out the chord progression &amp; rhythm (5:16)</li>
  <li>Figured out the alternating bass notes (15:07)</li>
  <li>Figured out the melody notes (29:39)</li>
</ul>

<p>To clarify, this is not a ‚Äúlesson‚Äù like most of my other videos‚Ä¶ because I haven‚Äôt fully learned this song yet! It‚Äôll honestly take me a few weeks of practice to get it fully learned (and I can record a proper lesson then). But again, I captured this first hour of learning it (i.e. writing up the tabs) and wanted to share this with you, in case helpful. If you aren‚Äôt interested in the transcribing process and only want the PDF chord sheet, you‚Äôre in luck! I‚Äôve made that and it‚Äôs available via the link just above.</p>

<p>One final note, this transcription is based off the version from John Prine‚Äôs 2000 album ‚ÄúSouvenirs‚Äù - where he performed many of his older hits. I learned this version because it only has one guitar, which makes it easier to hear the notes being played. This song was originally written &amp; released in 1972.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre interested in more John Prine, you‚Äôre in luck ‚Äì¬†I have a few of his other songs learned! There are so, so, so many more I want to learn &amp; add to this list, but for now I hope these are helpful.</p>
