<p>Hey friends! Hereâ€™s a quick exercise to help you practice your left-pinky pull-off technique. By pull-off, Iâ€™m referring to the opposite of a hammer-onâ€¦ where a finger is forcefully pulled â€œoffâ€ of a fretted string, such that it sounds like the string is being plucked.</p>

<p>Specially, weâ€™ll be doing these three transitions â€“â€“Â where the left pinky (highlighted) is initial positioned on the 3rd fretâ€¦</p>

<p>But then, after the pinky is pulled off, itâ€™s the red note shown below that will sound out, as if it was plucked.</p>

<p>This is a great way to add flourish to any riff in a way thatâ€™s done entirely with the left hand. This riff in particular includes a few of the most common pull-off scenarios beginner guitarists will encounter.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a preview of the full PDF (attached at the bottom of this post):</p>

<p>Thanks to supporter Erik for sending in the song I based this lesson off of (Chillin in the Backwoods by Jawga Boys). While I didnâ€™t know the song, this intro riff caught my ear at once â€“â€“ and I knew itâ€™d make for a good lesson showing this technique.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d eventually love to do some more focused lessons on the hammer-on and pull-off techniques with a very technical focus â€“ but until then, I trust this exercise might be a good one to try out.</p>

<p>Thanks and until next time âœŒï¸</p>
