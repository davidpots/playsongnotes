<h2 id="chord-shapes-needed">Chord shapes needed</h2>

<p>With a capo on 3rd fret, this song requires all the common chords in the key of D (D, Em, F#m, G, A, Bm). You could play these conventionally, or you can use the alternate voicings which I’ll also show. The common way to play these chords is as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E –––2––––3––––0––––2––––2––––0–––
B –––3––––3––––2––––3––––2––––0–––
G –––2––––0––––2––––4––––2––––0–––
D –––0––––0––––2––––4––––4––––2–––
A ––––––––2––––0––––2––––4––––2–––
E ––––––––3––––––––––––––2––––0–––
     D    G    A    Bm  F#m   Em
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the following voicings for all of the chords. This lets you skip out from ever playing a barre chord (which makes them easier, once you learn the shapes). An important thing to realize here is your left ring finger is on the same note for all of the chord shapes (3rd fret of the second string). Also, with the exception of the D chord, you’ll leave the high-E string open for all chords. Together, these give this group of chords a uniform &amp; consistent sound, via these droning notes.</p>

<p>Technically, these voicings deviate from the named chords in a strict sense - but don’t let that both you. Used well, these sound great. My advice with these is to lean into them when things are slower &amp; less hectic. Then, when things pickup to a full strum – switching to the regulard chord shapes (above) works well. Or, you could mix and match! It’s up to you. See my video lesson for reference.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E ––2––         –(0)–         –(0)–         –(0)–         –(0)–         –(0)––
B ––3––         ––3––         ––3––         ––3––         ––3––         ––3–––
G ––2––         ––2––         ––2––         ––2––         ––2––         ––0–––
D ––0––         ––0––         ––2––         ––0––         ––0––         ––2–––
A –––––         ––x––         ––0––         ––2––         ––x––         ––2–––
E –––––         ––3––         –––––         –––––         ––2––         ––0–––
    D             G             A             Bm           F#m            Em  
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="strumming-patterns">Strumming patterns</h2>

<p>This is a very long song, with many peaks &amp; valleys – so you’ll want to be a bit considered with whatever strumming pattern you use. Said another way, you probably don’t want to strum w/ the exact same pattern &amp; volume the entire time… that might get monotonous. I’ll show you a few options here, pick and choose from these options to put together a total package that works for your needs. Again, see my video lesson &amp; full play-along cover to see how I approach it.</p>

<h3 id="when-youre-starting-out">When you’re starting out…</h3>

<p>Just begin by doing a downstrum on the “1” count only. Get comfortable with the progression and vocal melody. Sneak in other strums here and there, if you want, but get familiar with that “1” count being your anchord &amp; foundation.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D
&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="adding-end-of-measure-strums">Adding end of measure strums…</h3>

<p>From there, you might try adding an “up-down-up” on the final 3 eighth notes of each measure… while keeping your “1” count bigger strum. This helps flesh things out a bit, and makes the chord changes (that always happen on the “1”) sound a bit more dramatic since they’ll be preceded by the trio of smaller strums.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D         U D U
&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="filling-it-out-even-more">Filling it out even more</h3>

<p>Finally, you could add some additional strums on the “2 + “ counts, while keeping the strums above. This is a pretty common pattern in itself, but I would recommend approaching things gingerly – and not over doing it. Keep the “1” count as your strongest strum, and view all these other strums as lighter filler strums. This will let you dial up (or down) the intensity of things, which is important for such a dynamic (and long) song.</p>
