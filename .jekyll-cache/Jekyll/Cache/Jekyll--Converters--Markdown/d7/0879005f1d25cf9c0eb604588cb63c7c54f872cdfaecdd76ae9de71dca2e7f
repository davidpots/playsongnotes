<p>VERSE
      D                   D7          G             Gm

      D                        D7               G             Gm
    Although (although) weâ€™re apartâ€” youâ€™re a partâ€” of my heartâ€”

    But tonightâ€¦ you belong to me</p>

<p>BRIDGE
            Gm             Gm            Gm               Gm
        Way downâ€¦ by the streamâ€¦ how sweetâ€¦ it will seem      <br />
             D               E7
        Once moreâ€¦ just to dream inâ€¦
               A7           A7 (let ring)
        â€¦the moonlightâ€¦..</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>            D                D7           G              Gm
My honey, I know... with the dawn--- that you--- will be gone---

      D           A7      D (let ring)
But tonight you belong to me

...Just a-little ole me

(end with optional trumpet solo using verse chords)

<h2 id="props-to-the-original-songwriter">Props to the original songwriter</h2>

<p>I have to note that this song was not written by Eddie Vedder. It was written in 1926 by lyricist Billy Rose and composer Lee David. Many others have covered it famously before Vedder did. I am giving credit to Vedder on this page simply because it is his rendition which inspired me to learn it, and Iâ€™m basing my chords and tabs off his version. For more info on the song, see the Wikipedia entry on it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonight_You_Belong_to_Me</p>

<h2 id="playing-the-chords-on-a-guitar">Playing the chords on a guitar</h2>

<p>Here is how you play the chords in this song on a guitar in standard tuning (I donâ€™t have a ukulele and am not sure if these would apply). To imitate a ukulele sound on your guitar, you can focus on playing on the highest 4 strings of your guitar for all these chords, if you like.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e-|----2----2----3----3----0----0----
B-|----3----1----0----3----2----3----
G-|----2----2----0----3----0----1----
D-|----0----0----0----5----2----2----
A-|-------------(2)--(5)--(0)--(2)---
E-|-------------(3)--(3)-------(0)---
       D    D7   G    Gm   A7   E7
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Gm is clearly the trickiest of these chords, especially if youâ€™re only used to playing open chords. One alternative approach to play the G (which makes the Gm transition easier) is to play the G in barre chord form also â€“ then you only need to lift a single finger to switch to the Gm.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e-|----3----3-----
B-|----3----3-----
G-|----4----3-----
D-|----5----5-----
A-|---(5)--(5)----
E-|---(3)--(3)----
       G    Gm
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="playing-the-intro-riff">Playing the intro riff</h2>

<p>Hereâ€™s how you play the intro riff, as heard on the Eddie Vedder album. Youâ€™re basically strumming a D chord and adding your pinky to play Dsus4 at that key moment. Listen along for reference.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>e-|----2-2-2-2---3-2---------|-
B-|----3-3-3-3---3-3----3----|-
G-|----2-2-2-2---2-2----2----|-
D-|----0---------------------0----|-   ...play twice
A-|-------------------------------|-
E-|-------------------------------|-
       1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a
       D            Dsus4    D
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Playing the End-of-Verse Riff
If you listen to the end of the first verse in the Eddie Vedder version, youâ€™ll hear a nice little walkdown riff he plays at the end of the first riff. Hereâ€™s how you play it. This is a nice way to add some spice and variation to the song.</p>

<p>e-|â€”-2â€“2â€“2â€“2â€”-3â€“2â€”â€”â€”|â€”5â€“5â€“5â€“3â€”â€“2â€“2â€“2â€“0â€”||
B-|â€”-3â€“3â€“3â€“3â€”-3â€“3â€”-3â€”-|â€”3â€“3â€“3â€“3â€”â€“2â€“2â€“2â€“2â€”||
G-|â€”-2â€“2â€“2â€“2â€”-2â€“2â€”-2â€”-|â€”3â€“3â€“3â€“3â€”â€“2â€“2â€“2â€“0â€”||
D-|â€”-0â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”0â€”-|â€”5â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“2â€”â€”â€“2â€”||
A-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“(0)â€”â€”â€”â€“||
E-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-||
       D            Dsus4    D        Gm             A</p>

<p>An alternative, easier way to play something very similar is like this. Here, youâ€™re sliding the same chord position down the fretboard:</p>

<p>e-|â€”-2â€“2â€“2â€“2â€”-3â€“2â€”â€”â€”|â€”5â€”-/4â€”-/3â€”-||
B-|â€”-3â€“3â€“3â€“3â€”-3â€“3â€”-3â€”-|â€”4â€”-/3â€”-/2â€”-||
G-|â€”-2â€“2â€“2â€“2â€”-2â€“2â€”-2â€”-|â€”4â€”-/3â€”-/2â€”-||
D-|â€”-0â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”0â€”-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“||
A-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“||
E-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“||
       D            Dsus4    D</p>

<p>Playing the Pre-Bridge Riff
If you listen to the measure just before the bridge in the Eddie Vedder recording, there is a nice little walk-up leading to the Gm in the chorus. You can approximate it on guitar playing it like this. Listen along for reference, and be sure to give voicing to the notes on the highest string.</p>

<p>e-|â€”-2â€“2â€“2â€“2â€”-3â€“2â€”â€”â€”|â€”â€”0â€“2â€”â€“2â€“3â€“5â€”-||
B-|â€”-3â€“3â€“3â€“3â€”-3â€“3â€”-3â€”-|â€”3â€“3â€“3â€”â€“3â€“3â€“3â€”-||
G-|â€”-2â€“2â€“2â€“2â€”-2â€“2â€”-2â€”-|â€”2â€”â€”â€”â€“2â€”â€”â€”-||
D-|â€”-0â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”0â€”-|â€”0â€”â€”â€”â€“0â€”â€”â€”-||
A-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“||
E-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-|â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“||
       D            Dsus4    D</p>
