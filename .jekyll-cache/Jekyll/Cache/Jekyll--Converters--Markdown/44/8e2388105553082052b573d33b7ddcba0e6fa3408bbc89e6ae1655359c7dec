<h2 id="editors-notes">Editorâ€™s notes</h2>

<p>In this lesson Iâ€™ll show you one of my go-to warmup exercises from the past few years, which involves playing the E-major with the thinnest four strings â€“Â and adding flourish with your left pinky and ring finger. This takes an otherwise familiar &amp; common chord, and mixes it up a bit: youâ€™re getting a slight less full sound (from only playing 4 strings), but you benefit from having a few extra fingers to add meldoic flourish notes with. Iâ€™ll show it all to you: the chord shapes, the riff, the strumming, including in tab. I hope you enjoy.</p>

<p>I should note, this is based on the background lead guitar part Father John Misty song â€œIâ€™m Writing a Novelâ€ â€“Â which is track 4 from his great album â€œFear Funâ€. The riff first comes in after he finishes the first verse â€“Â itâ€™s subtle, but itâ€™s there.</p>
