<p>Hey friends! Hereâ€™s a quick video showing you how you can get access to my library of over 200 print-friendly PDF chord sheets, each of which pairs with one of my video guitar lessons on my YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s how to access the library of PDFs yourself:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sign up @ <a href="https://patreon.com/songnotes">patreon.com/songnotes</a></li>
  <li>Youâ€™ll get notified of new PDFs via email, which link you to Patreon to download</li>
  <li>Browse all my past lessons @ <a href="https://playsongnotes.com">playsongnotes.com</a>, where each lesson page links back to the corresponding Patreon page with the attached PDF.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks!</p>
