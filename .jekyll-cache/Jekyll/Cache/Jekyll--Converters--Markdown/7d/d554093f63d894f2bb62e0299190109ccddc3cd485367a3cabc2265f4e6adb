<h2 id="tune-down-a-whole-step-to-play-with-neils-version">Tune down a whole step to play with Neil’s version</h2>

<p>To play along with Neil Young’s version (e.g., on Rust Never Sleeps) you’ll need to tune your guitar down one whole step (DGCFAD). However, in my video lesson above, I’m staying in standard tuning to keep things easy.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-play-the-chords">How to play the chords</h2>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E ||–––0––––3––––0––––0––––0––––
B ||–––1––––0––––1––––1––––3––––
G ||–––2––––0––––2––––0––––0––––
D ||–––2––––0––––3––––2––––2––––
A ||–––0––––2–––––––––3––––2––––
E ||––––––––3––––––––––––––0––––
       Am   G  Fmaj7  C   Em7
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming pattern</h2>

<p>I’m a bit torn on this – do you copy Neil, or use your own pattern? He’s so loose with his strumming, I’m hesitant to try to quantify it into a single pattern. Here’s what I recommend to start with – do with this what you will:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D   D   D U D U
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Use that for all verses and refrains –– no matter which chord you’re playing. For example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Am              G               Fmaj7
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D   D   D U D U D   D   D U D U D   D   D U D U D   D   D U D U
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C               Em7             Am              Fmaj7
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
D   D   D U D U D   D   D U D U D   D   D U D U D   D   D U D U
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="how-to-learn-the-riff">How to learn the riff</h2>

<h3 id="start-with-the-chords-and-strumming">Start with the chords and strumming</h3>

<p>First, learn these chords and understand the timing (e.g., Am for one measure, G for one measure, Fmaj7 for 2 measures). I also recommend practicing strumming here, whether you want to keep it simple or be loose and free like Neil.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E ||–––0–––––––––––––-–3–––––––––––––––0–––––––––––––––0––––––––––––––––
B ||–––1–––––––––––––-–0–––––––––––––––1–––––––––––––––1––––––––––––––––
G ||–––2–––––––––––––-–0–––––––––––––––2–––––––––––––––2––––––––––––––––
D ||–––2–––––––––––––-–0–––––––––––––––3–––––––––––––––3––––––––––––––––
A ||–––0–––––––––––––-–2––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
E ||–––––––––––––––––––3––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
       Am              G               Fmaj7           Fmaj7
       1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="adding-lead-notes-but-keeping-it-simple">Adding lead notes, but keeping it simple</h3>

<p>Next, add some of the foundational lead notes as shown below. If this is tough for you, stick to this simplified tab (below) and take it slow. Watch my video and listen to Neil for reference. This tab below omits some of the strummy nuance, just to help get you through the front door. A final note: it may be easier to use all downstrums at this stage, for the lead notes especially (i.e., the notes between the strums).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E ||–––––––0–––––––––––––––3––––––––––(0)––0–––0–0–0–0(0)––0–––0–0–0–0––
B ||–––––––1–––––––––––––––0––––––––––(1)––1–––1–1–1–1(1)––1–––1–1–1–1––
G ||–––––––2–––––––––––––––0–––––––––––2–––2–––2–2–2–2–2–––2–––2–2–2–2––
D ||–––––––2–––––––––0–––––0–––––––––––3–––3–––3–3–3–3–3–––3–––3–3–3–3––
A ||–––0–––––––0–2–3–––––––––––2–0–––0––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
E ||–––––––––––––––––––3–––––––––––3––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
       Am              G               Fmaj7           Fmaj7
       1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="advanced-version-with-nuance">Advanced version with nuance</h3>

<p>This is my attempt to tab it out exactly like Neil plays it. There’s a bit more strum nuance, and a bit more delicacy with the lead notes. Not shown in the tab below is the hammer-on that occur in the first note after the full G-chord strum (see my video for reference):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E ||–––––––0–0–––––––––––3–3–3–––––––––––0–0–––0–0–0–0–––0–0–––––0–0–0––
B ||–––––––1–1–––––––––––0–0–0–––––––––––1–1–––1–1–1–1–––1–1–––––1–1–1––
G ||–––––––2–2–––––––––––0–0–0–––––––––––2–2–––2–2–2–2–––2–2–––––2–2–2––
D ||–––––––2–2–––––––0–––0–0–0–––––––––––3–3–––3–3–3–3–––3–3–––––3–3–3––
A ||–––0–––––––0–2–3–––––––––––2–0–––0––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
E ||––––––––––––––––––(3)––––––––––3––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
       Am              G               Fmaj7
       1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, here’s a modified version of the riff – the only difference between the lead phrase immediately after the G-chord strum (which can start off with a hammer-on as well).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>E ||–––––––0–0–––––––––––3–3–3–––––––––––0–0–––0–0–0–0–––0–0–––––0–0–0––

       1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
