<h2>Unavailable song sheets I'll be re-listing soon...</h2>

<p><em>To request that I prioritize any song listed below, go to the lesson page for that song (using the search bar at the top of my website), and click the blue button that says "Request This Song".</em></p>

<p><em>Note, it's up to my discretion as to which songs I re-list next. While I absolutely do favor the songs with the most votes, I will sometimes pick and choose based on a number of external factors (difficulty of reformatting, etc). Thanks for your understanding!</em></p>
