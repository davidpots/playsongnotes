<h1>Why some of my song sheets are unavailable, and how to vote for the song I re-list next!</h1>

<h2>Recently re-added song sheets...</h2>

Here's the songs I've most recently re-listed for purchase at Musicnotes.com. Each arrangement is officially licensed & legal, and also uses my latest sheet music formatting.

Note, as of June 2022 I've slowed down a bit (with re-listing some of these older PDFs) due to some other behind-the-scenes things I'm working on. But fear not, I do plan on getting back to these at some point! And you can always check out my weekly new lessons, which I am keeping up with.

<h2>Unavailable song sheets I'll be re-listing soon...</h2>

<p><em>To request that I prioritize any song listed below, go to the lesson page for that song (using the search bar at the top of my website), and click the blue button that says "Request This Song".</em></p>

<p><em>Note, it's up to my discretion as to which songs I re-list next. While I absolutely do favor the songs with the most votes, I will sometimes pick and choose based on a number of external factors (difficulty of reformatting, etc). Thanks for your understanding!</em></p>
