<h1>How to Get My Instructional PDFs & Song Sheets</h1>

<p class="font-size--large">Guitar can be complicated to learn! While my free video lessons will get you started in learning songs or techniques, I believe there is immense value in print-friendly diagrams that you can reference alongside my video lessons. I take great pride in creating diagrams to explain the concepts behind strumming patterns, fretboard & chord charts, scales, tablature, and more.</p>

<h2>Instructional PDFs (non-songs)</h2>

<p>Approximately half my video lessons teach general guitar techniques: tips, quick riffs & exercises, practical music theory, and more.

Each PDF is print-friendly, and typically between 2 and 5 pages. Here's what they look like (showing the first page only):</p>
