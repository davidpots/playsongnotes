## Editor's notes

Hello my friends! Lesson today where I'll teach you a relatively simple bluesy riff in the open E position –– and then show how you can play that *same* riff in 4 other places on the fretboard. This comes out of practice and noodling I've been doing this past week, using my [FretMonster tool](http://fretmonster.net) as an aid to help me see these possibilities. If you, like me, are interested in taking some early steps into extending your lead guitar skillset – I trust you'll find this lesson valuable!

To explore the fretboard as I am during this lesson, visit [FretMonster](http://fretmonster.net) and select "Key of E" along with "Major + ♭7". This will show you the map I'm using during my lesson. And of course, in my 1-page PDF I have the different regions that each riff uses circled -- in addition to showing you the tabs for each of the 5 positions. Let's get into it!

## Song that inspired this lesson

Here's the Midland song "Mr. Lonely" whose bassline inspired this lesson. Give it a listen! Here's the lyric video:

And here's the director's cut version of the music video (starring Dennis Quaid), which has a bit of non-song footage to start with:
