## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll teach you how to play Neil Young's classic song "Old Man" from his 1972 album Harvest. From start to finish, I'll teach you each part of the song: the chord shapes, progressions & timing, strumming patterns, and tabs (both beginner-friendly and advanced) for each section. While this is a tricky song, it's very much possible to simplify each part to make it more accessible without a ton of practice.

A final note, if the intro is giving you trouble -- check out the other video lesson I made, which is a 20 minute deep dive on nailing the strumming of the very difficult first chord.

## Chord shapes needed

Here's the chords you'll need for this song. I'm showing the two intro chords on the left (as their own group), so you can see how similar the shapes are. Opposite these chords are what you'll need for the verse and chorus. Fortunately, nothing too crazy here -- for the F I usually just only play the middle 4 stings, which is what it looks like Neil does too (but you can use a full F barre chord if you want).

## Chord progressions

### Intro

Play 2x before singing, then 2x with "Old man, look at my life" vocals.

    Dm9             Dm9             Dm9             D               D
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

### Verse

Notice how the 1st and 3rd lines are the exact same... it's the 2nd and 4th lines that deviate from the norm.

    D               F               C               G
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D               F               C               F
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D               F               C               G
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D               C               F               G
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

### Chorus

Play 4x. Note how the "Em" and "G" chord changes don't happen on the "1" count.

    D               D               Am7         Em            G  
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

If you want an easier version, move the "Em" and "G" changes to the 1 and 3 count, respectively:

    D               D               Am7             Em      G  
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

## Intro tab

### Simplified version

Here's a very basic version to get started with... add strumming only if you feel comfortable.

### My secret stash tab

Here's the "exact" tab I like to play. I give the highlighted notes below a bit more emphasis, to add some sense of melody to things. But please note, feel free to ignore this if you find an approach that works for you.

## Verse tab

Here's how I recommend playing the first two lines of the verse, complete with the hammer-ons that imitate what Neil is playing.

         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

    E ||–2–––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–

         D                 F                 C                 F                
         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

## Chorus tab

### Basic version

Finally, the chorus. Big picture, the chords and timing in tablature form look like this. A tricky new element here is the timing -- in particular the switch to the Em and G do not happen on the "1" count as you might expect. For the G chord, I recommend starting with an up-strum (so that you do an "up down up" on the "+4+" counts).

      "...Old man take a look...   ...I'm a lot  like   you.................."
    E ||–2–––––––––––––––|–2–––––––––––––––|–0–––––––––––0–––|–––––––––––3–––––|–
    B ||–3–––––––––––––––|–3–––––––––––––––|–1–––––––––––0–––|–––––––––––0–––––|–

    A ||–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–0–––––––––––2–––|–––––––––––2–––––|–
    E ||–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––0–––|–––––––––––3–––––|–
         D                 D                 Am7         Em              G
         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

### Walking up into the chorus

To get the high-score, you'll want to nail this riff going out of the verse and into the chorus (no vocals are heard during this part). Note that it starts on the "G" chord that *ends* the chorus... specifically, you'll be walking up from the G immediately into the D chord that begins the chorus. In this tab, I'm showing the "main" notes & strums... you can freely add additional filler strumming, but just be sure you emphasize everything shown below.
