## Lyrics w/ chords

    VERSE
    D            A             Bm           F#m  G
    ...Sometimes I feel like I don’t have a part-ner
    D            A           Bm      G
    ...Sometimes I feel like my only friend
           D      A            Bm      F#m  G
    Is the city I live in, the city of An – gels
    D         A       Bm        G    Dmaj7
    Lonely as I am, together we cry

      D            A             Bm          F#m G
    I drive on the streets cause she’s my companion
      D                A               Bm          G
    I walk through the hills cause she knows who I am
        D            A             Bm        F#m G
    She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
          D       A          Bm        G     Dmaj7
    Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

    CHORUS
         Em              D      A       Em
        I don’t ever wanna feel--- like I did that day
         Em                  D       A      Em
        Take me to the place I love--- take me all the way
         Em              D      A       Em
        I don’t ever wanna feel--- like I did that day
         Em                  D       A      Em
        Take me to the place I love--- take me all the way

    D    A      Bm     F#m G        D    A   Bm   G
    Way, yeah..............

         D           A                   Bm      F#m   G
    It's hard to believe that... there's nobody out there
         D          A            Bm        G
    It's hard to believe... that I’m all alone
       D            A               Bm        F#m  G
    At least I have heard of... the city she loves me
    D         A          Bm       G     Dmaj7
    Lonely as I am... together we cry

         Em                D    A       Em
        I don’t ever wanna feel--- like I did that day
         Em                    D     A      Em
        Take me to the place I love--- take me all the way
         Em                D    A       Em
        I don’t ever wanna feel--- like I did that day
         Em                    D     A      Em
        Take me to the place I love--- take me all the way

    REFRAIN

            G                    Gm     F          Ebmaj7

            G                    Gm     F         Ebmaj7
            Under the bridge downtown..... forgot about my love
            G                    Gm     F         Ebmaj7            G Gm F Ebmaj7 (repeat)
            Under the bridge downtown..... I gave my life away

## Capo notes

To play along with the Red Hot Chili Peppers version of the song, use these chords with a capo on the 2nd fret. I should also note, this is not how the RHCP play the song –– I'm choosing to play it this way in either to keep it simple (less crazy barre chords).
