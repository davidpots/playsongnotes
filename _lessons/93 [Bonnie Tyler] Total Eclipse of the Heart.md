## Capo 1st fret

If you want to play along with Bonnie Tyler's recorded version of the song, you'll need to put a capo on the 1st fret and use all chords and tabs below. You could also not use a capo and use the chords - but note you'll be in a different key than the album version of this song (which may not be a big deal unless you're trying to play along with it).

## Intro riff, simplified

Put your left hand in the A-minor position, and play the riff as follows. Note that you want to omit the high E-string, and accent the thinnest string (in each strum) to drive the melody notes home.

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –––––––1––0––––––––––1––0––––––
    G –––––––2––2––2–––––––2––2––2–––
    D –––––2–––––––2–––––2–––––––2–––   ...repeat as desired
    A –––0–––––––––––––0–––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
         Am

## Chords needed:

    E –––0––––3––––0––––––––––––––4––––0––––2––––0––––2––––2––––
    B –––1––––3––––1––––3––––8––––4––––0––––3––––2––––0––––3––––
    G –––2––––0––––0––––3––––8––––5––––0––––2––––0––––2––––2––––
    D –––2––––0––––2––––3––––8––––6––––2––––0––––2––––1––––0––––
    A –––0––––2––––3––––1––––6––––6––––2–––––––––0––––2––––0––––
    E ––––––––3–––––––––––––––––––4––––0–––––––––––––––––––2––––
         Am   G    C    Bb   Eb   Ab   Em   D    A7   B7  D/F#

## Strumming pattern:

I keep the strumming pattern quite simple:

    D = downstrum   U = upstrum

    D       D   D U
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

That same pattern, as if spoken out loud, would be this (keep on repeating it):

    Down... down, down up down... down, down up down... down, down up down...

## Song structure

## Lyrics w/ chords

    VERSE
        Am                                   G
        Turnaround, every now & then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming round
        Am                                   G
        Turnaround, every now & then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
        C                                    Bb
        Turnaround, every now & then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
        C                                    Bb
        Turnaround, every now & then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
        Eb          Ab
        Turnaround, bright eyes... but every now and then I fall apart
        Eb          Ab
        Turnaround, bright eyes... every now and then I fall apart

    CHORUS
        G        Em             C            D
        ...And I need you now tonight, and I need you more than ever
        G             Em           C               D
        ...And if you only hold me tight, we'll be holding on forever
        G            Em                C                    D
        ...And we'll only be making it right, because we'll never be wrong
          C                            D
        Together we can take it to the end of the line
             Em                          A7
        Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
          C                             D
        I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
              Em                         A7
        We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
                            G
        I really need you tonight
           D/F#         G       C         D
        Forever's gonna start tonight, forever's gonna start tonight

    ENDING
        G                      Em                   B7                   C
        Once upon a time I was falling in love, but now I'm only falling apart
                    Am                  D                    G     Em    C    D
        And there's nothing I can do, a total eclipse of the heart
        G                          Em                    B7                           C
        Once upon a time there was light in my life, but now there's only love in the dark
        Am                   D                    G     Em    C    D
        Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart
