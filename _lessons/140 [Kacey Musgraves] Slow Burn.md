## Editor's notes

In this video I'll teach you how to play Slow Burn by Kacey Musgraves on the acoustic guitar. This is the opening track from Kacey Musgraves 2018 album "Golden Hour". It uses the same 4 chords for most of the song... I'll show you play to play them and also break down the strumming pattern.

## How to play the chords

The easiest way to play the chords is as follows (left). However, the two best things you can do to spice up the song is use the Asus2 (in place of a regular A) and this Dsus2, both shown on the right.

    E –––0––––0––––3––––0––––0–––        E –––––0–––––––0–––––
    B –––2––––0––––0––––3––––1–––        B –––––0–––––––3–––––
    G –––2––––0––––0––––2––––0–––        G –––––2–––––––0–––––
    D –––2––––2––––0––––0––––2–––        D –––––2–––––––4–––––
    A –––0––––2––––2–––––––––3–––        A –––––0–––––––5–––––
    E ––––––––0––––3–––––––––––––        E –––––––––––––––––––
         A    Em   G  Dsus2  C                Asus2   Dsus2  

## Chords progression

With the exception of the bridge, the entire song uses this progression.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    A               Em              G               Dsus2

Sometimes, she'll swap out the E minor and play a C instead, such as this. Watch live videos of her playing for reference.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    A               C               G               Dsus2

## Strumming pattern

To keep it very easy, start with all down strums. If you can add, an accent to the "3" count.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D   D
            >

And from there, you could add an up-strum on the "+" count following the 4.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D   D U
            >

Finally: if you wish, add alternating up-strums between each down strum. Keep the accent on the 3!

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D U D U D U D U
            >

For an "advanced" strumming pattern, you can use this -- which takes 2 measures to play.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D   D U   U D   D   D U
            >               >

        Born in a hurry, always late, haven't been early since '88
           A          Em             G                    Dsus2            A Em G Dsus2
        Texas is hot, I can be cold, Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
        A                Em
        Good in a glass, good on green...
        G                             Dsus2                A Em G
        Good when you're putting your hands all over me

            I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright...
            G                         Dsus2
            If we burn it down and it takes all night
                   A            Em    G    Dsus2
            It's a slow burn---------------------- yeah

        In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down...
            G                   Dsus2               A Em G Dsus2

                      A                         Em
        You know, the bar down the street don't close for an hour...
        G                      Dsus2                     A     Em  G  
        We should take a walk..... and look at all the flowers

            Dsus2              A           Em   G
            I'm alright with a slow burn-------
            Dsus2                   A            E   G   Dsus2
            Taking my time, let the world turn-----------
                      A                   Em

            G                         Dsus2
            If we burn it down and it takes all night
                   A            Em    G    Dsus2
            It's a slow burn----------------------

                C                              Em    
                ...Mmmmm, whatever feels good.......
                A     Em   G   Dsus2    A     Em   G   Dsus2  
                Ahhhh......             Ahhhh......             (repeat "ahh" 4x)

          [BREAK: A-Em-G-Dsus2 x2, with lighter strumming]

        A         Em                   G                   
        Old soul, waiting my turn... I know a few things...
                 Dsus2              A     Em   G    
        ...but I still got a lot to learn
           Dsus2              A          Em   G    Dsus2
        So I'm alright with a slow burn-----------
        A          Em   G    Dsus2     A          Em   G    Dsus2    
        Slow burn---------             Slow burn---------           
                                                    (repeat, end on Asus2)

Her Late Show w/ Stephen Colbert version  -- I love this one! It's where I first learned about Kacey Musgraves and I think it's a great performance.
