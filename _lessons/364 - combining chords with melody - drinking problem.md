## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Quick riff exercise here, where I take on the challenge of adding a distinctive melody line into 4 measures of strummed chords. This lesson teaches how to approach this step by step, so that you're modifying the strummed chords one step at a time -- but always working toward the end goal of playing them both at once. The final result is a 4-measure sequence that sounds "full" because of the constant strumming -- yet also has that "hummable" quality because of the melody notes you've integrated. I hope you enjoy!

## What inspired this lesson

The song Drinking Problem by Midland is the partial inspiration for this lesson. Specifically, the post-chorus (bridge?) section where he sing "Call it a problem, I call it a solution" mimics the shape of the melody I am playing here.
