Hey friends! Here's a quick video showing you how you can get access to my library of over 200 print-friendly PDF chord sheets, each of which pairs with one of my video guitar lessons on my YouTube channel.

Here's how to access the library of PDFs yourself:

1. Sign up @ <a href="https://patreon.com/songnotes">patreon.com/songnotes</a>
2. You'll get notified of new PDFs via email, which link you to Patreon to download
3. Browse all my past lessons @ <a href="https://playsongnotes.com">playsongnotes.com</a>, where each lesson page links back to the corresponding Patreon page with the attached PDF.

Thanks!
