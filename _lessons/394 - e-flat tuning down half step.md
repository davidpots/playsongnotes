## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Lesson today showing a quick overview of how to tune down 1/2 step, so that you're in E-flat tuning. Alongside Drop D, I would wager this is the most common alternate tuning you'll run into when playing guitar. The concept is actually quite simple: tune all the strings down one half-step!

The great part about this tuning is you can play everything normally -- no special chord substitutions are needed. The catch: everything you play will be lower in pitch, so you might not be able to play along with recordings (or fellow musicians) unless you're tuned the same. But of course, many songs are recorded this way -- so being able to tune "down" (in pitch) to match the recorded instruments is quite handy.

If the order of the 12 notes isn't something you've learned yet, I strongly recommend my practical music theory lesson where I explain the 12 musical notes, in addition to must-know terms (pitch, sharp vs flat, tone vs. semitone, half step vs whole step, etc).
