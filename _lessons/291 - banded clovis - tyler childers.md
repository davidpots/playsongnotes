## Lyrics with chords

Capo 3rd fret.

         E           E          A              E
    Tina Nolan had a man with a good place for siftin'
       E          E             E            B7
    He invited me diggin', so I picked up my screen
          E         E         A        E
    And a shovel to dig and a jar of shine
       E         E          B7        E
    He traded me fair for a bottle of wine
        A         B7              E       E
    His brother's Barnes Mountain wine

    We [E] trudged through the [E] snow, [A] straight up the [E] hillside
    Took a [E] ridge for a [E] while, then we [E] slowly went [B7] down
    To an [E] over-[E]-hang [A] hid from the [E] ridgeline
    We [E] bent o'er our [E] handles and we [B7] bit in the [E] ground
    The [A] dark and [B7] bloody [E] ground [E]

    Was a [E] bitch to break [E] ground but the [A] wine kept us [E] goin'
    The [E] moonshine was [E] flowin' and [E] keepin' us [B7] warm
    'Cause you [E] can't hold a [E] girl with a [A] fistful of [E] shovel
    Got to [E] find your [E] fire in the [B7] company of [E] corn

    [A] [B7] [E] [E]

    We [E] dug for a [E] while then it [A] all turned to [E] ashes
    Found a [E] bunch of broke [E] flint and a [E] few bits of [B7] bone
    Then I [E] heard Jesse [E] yell o'er the [A] pile he was [E] sifting
    Shook the [E] hills like the [E] angels were [B7] callin' us [E] home
    [A] Jesse, [B7] Zachary come [E] home [E]

    It was [E] banded as [E] hell, it was [A] fluted and [E] clovis
    It was [E] hot as the [E] pistol I [E] kept on my [B7] side
    I was [E] fiending so [E] fierce, I was [A] broke ass and [E] busted
    I [E] pulled out my [E] pistol and I [B7] took Jesse's [E] life

    [A] [B7] [E] [E]

    A [E] clovis like [E] that is a [A] hard point to [E] find
    Makes [E] pills swift to [E] come by with a [E] good chunk of [B7] change
    Left [E] over for [E] burn on [A] whatever [E] meanness
    [E] Whatever [E] woman is [B7] comin' my [E] way
    [A] Darlin' [B7] come my [E] way [E]

    I [E] sit in this [E] cell for the [A] banded [E] clovis
    I [E] stole off of [E] Nolan when I [E] killed'm that [B7] day
    I [E] reckon the [E] chase of the [A] pills and the [E] powder
    Corn [E] liquor and [E] woman are the [B7] culprits to [E] blame

    [A] [B7] [E] [E]
