## Lyrics w/ chords

    (capo 2nd fret if you want to play along with the official version)

    INTRO

        G ... G ....

    VERSE

        G                Em
        ...Almost heaven... West Virginia
        D                          C          G
        ...Blue Ridge Mountains... Shenandoah River
        G                     Em
        ...Life is old there, older than the trees
        D                           C              G
        Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

    CHORUS
                    G              D              Em        C
            Country roads, take me home... to the place I belong             
                    G               D               C             G
            West Virginia, mountain mama... take me home, country roads

        G                   Em
        ...All my memories... gather around her
        D                C                G
        ...Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
        G                  Em
        ...Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
        D                         C              G
        Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

                    G              D              Em        C
            Country roads, take me home... to the place I belong             
                    G               D               C             G
            West Virginia, mountain mama... take me home, country roads

    BRIDGE

                Em            D             G
                ...I hear her voice, in the morning hour, she calls me
                    C       G              D
                The radio reminds me of my home far away
                    Em               F            C
                And driving down the road I get a feeling
                       G                     D                D7  
                That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

                    G              D              Em        C
            Country roads, take me home... to the place I belong             
                    G               D               C             G
            West Virginia, mountain mama... take me home, country roads
                    C             G                C             G
            Take me home, country roads... take me home, country roads



## Capo notes

If you want to use the chords above and play along with John Denver's official version, you'll need a capo on the 2nd fret. Without a capo, you'd need to use chords in the key of A to play along with John Denver (which makes a bit tougher, since a barre chord is needed for F#m). Otherwise, you can use no capo (using the chords I show) and you’ll sound just fine on your own.

## Understanding the timing of each chord

We'll have 4 counts per measure. Chords are either played for 1 or 2 measures, depending on the part of the song. Here's a look at the chord progressions used for each section. Everytime you see a chord name, play that chord for 4 counts (1 measure). If you see a slash ("/"), repeat the prior chord for an additional measure.

Verse:

    G  /  Em  /  D  /  C  G

Chorus:

    G  /  D  /  Em  /  C  /
    G  /  D  /  C   /  G  /

Bridge:

    Em  D   G   /
    C   G   D   /
    Em  F   C   G
    D   /   D7  /

## How to play the chords

Here's how to play the chords you'll need. For the F chord, you can get away with the "easy" approach of only playing the middle four strings - this prevents you from needing to play a full barre chord, which is more difficult.

    E –––3––––0––––0––––2––––2–––(1)–––
    B –––0––––0––––1––––3––––1––––1––––
    G –––0––––0––––0––––2––––2––––2––––
    D –––0––––2––––2––––0––––0––––3––––
    A –––2––––2––––3––––––––––––––3––––
    E –––3––––0––––––––––––––––––(1)–––
         G    Em   C    D    D7   F

## How to strum this song

Quite simply, the easiest way is to use all down strums -- and accent the "2" and "4" counts in each 4 count measure.

    1  2  3  4            D = downstrum
    D  D  D  D            > = accented strum
       >     >

To take this a step further, for the "1" and "3" try only playing the bass note the chord with your picking hand. For example:

    E –––––3–––––3––  –––––0–––––0––  –––––0–––––0––  –––––2–––––2––
    B –––––0–––––0––  –––––0–––––0––  –––––1–––––1––  –––––3–––––3––
    G –––––0–––––0––  –––––0–––––0––  –––––0–––––0––  –––––2–––––2––
    D –––––0–––––0––  –––––2–––––2––  –––––2–––––2––  ––0––0––0––0––  etc
    A –––––2–––––2––  –––––2–––––2––  ––3––3––3––3––  ––––––––––––––
    E ––3––3––3––3––  ––0––0––0––0––  ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––
        G               Em              C               D          
        1  2  3  4      1  2  3  4      1  2  3  4      1  2  3  4  
           >     >         >     >         >     >         >     >  

## Alternating bass notes

    E –––––3–––––3–––––3–––––3––  –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0––  
    B –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0––  –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0––  
    G –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0––  –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0––  
    D ––––––––0–––––––––––0–––––  ––––––––2–––––––––––2–––––  
    A ––––––––––––––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
    E ––3–––––––––––3–––––––––––  ––0–––––––––––0–––––––––––  
        G                           Em                         
        1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4      1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4    
           >     >     >     >         >     >     >     >
