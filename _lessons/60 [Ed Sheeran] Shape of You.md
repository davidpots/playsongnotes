## Capo and chords needed

This entire song uses the same progression:

    C#m . . . F#m . . . A . . . B . . .

These chords the vi, ii, IV, and V triads in the key of E major. By adding a capo, we can play the same relative progression but use different chord shapes. Here's a map of the chords you'd need, depending on where you used a capo (if at all):

              vi   ii   IV  V
              ------------------
    No Capo   C#m  F#m  A   B
    Capo 2    Bm   Em   G   A
    Capo 4    Am   Dm   F   G
    Capo 9    Em   Am   C   D

In this lesson, I'll show you how to play the chords and intro riff for each the keys above.
