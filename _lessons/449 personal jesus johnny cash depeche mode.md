## Editor's notes

In this week's lesson I'll teach you how to play **_Personal Jesus_** as covered by Johnny Cash. Originally recorded by Depeche Mode in 1989, Cash's version of this song is an amazing reinterpretation that fits perfectly within his country & blues guitar style. The song is characterized by a bassline riff, played with the thickest 3 strings on the guitar, used throughout. I'll walk you through the process of learning & mastering this riff, in addition to teaching you the strumming & basslines needed in the verse, chorus, and bridge sections of the song. This one is a blast to play, I hope you enjoy!

## Lyrics and chords

See my 3-page song sheet! It's all on page 1, carefully formatted to nicely fit on a single page while still being readable. Pages 2 & 3 include tabs and strumming for the entire song, plus some additional exercises to help you learn the main riff.

## Notes on Depeche Mode's Recording

Depeche Mode originally recorded this song in 1989. The tabs & chords I show in my lesson above will work for their version as well, though there are two things to take note of:

### 1️⃣ Tune Up One Whole Step (or use capo 2)

Regarding tuning, you'll need to tune all strings _up_ a whole step to play along with Depeche Mode's version. Alternatively, you could use a capo on the 2nd fret and stay in standard tuning. Johnny Cash's version is played in standard tuning, with no capo.

### 2️⃣ Use Swing Eighth Notes

Regarding rhythm, the eighth notes in Depeche Mode's recordings are played with swing. This means that the "AND" eighth note count in each measure's _one AND two AND three AND four AND_ all come a slight bit _late_.

Here's audio of the main riff played **with swing**:

Alternatively, Cash's version has the eight notes played "straight" —— meaning there is no swing. his means that the "AND" eighth note count in each measure's _one AND two AND three AND four AND_ are equally spaced between quarter notes.

Here's audio of the main riff played **straight**:

Note, both audio samples above are played at the same tempo (i.e. the pace of the quarter notes on the "1 2 3 4" counts). In this case, it's 120bpm for both audio clips shown above. The presence of eighth note swing has no impact on a song's tempo.
