## Capo to make things easier?

If you want, you can dodge the B-flat and F chords by using a capo (which lets you play along with the album version of this song). I won't break it down in detail here, but the cheat sheet to do such is this:

              I  III  IV  V  vi
              ----------------------
    No Capo   F   A   Bb  C  Dm    
    Capo 1    E   G#  A   B  C#m
    Capo 3    D   F#  G   A  Bm
    Capo 5    C   E   F   G  Am

Note, you'll need to use barre chords one way or another, for the most part.

## Chord progression

Intro / verse / pre-chorus:

    Bb . . . F . . . C . . . Dm . . . (repeat)

Chorus / post-chorus:

    A . Bb . F . C . (repeat)

## Strumming

Use all down strums, ideally accenting every other strum. Throw in a down-up just before every chord change:

    DOWN down DOWN down DOWN down DOWN down up
    DOWN down DOWN down DOWN down DOWN down up
    DOWN down DOWN down DOWN down DOWN down up

    etc

## Lyrics

    Lighting stog after stog, choke on the smoke
    They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
    Help me forget that this world is so cold
    I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more

    Tell me what I wantjust keep searchin' on
    It's never enough, cup after cup,
    blunt after blunt I wouldn't give one
    if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha

        In the cut and I put that on my momma
        And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
        I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
        It's either the pussy or the commas

            Man I just wanna go flex
            Gold on my teeth and on my neck
            And I'm stone cold with the flex
            With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
            (repeat)

    Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
    She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
    She got a man but says she really like me
    She doin' things to excite me

    She sending all her friends snaps of my new tracks
    'Cause all these hoes know whats about to come next
    I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
    I drop a couple bands I just wanna go

        [ chorus x 1 ]

            Knowing all of this
            It just don’t make a difference
            I’m just talking shit to the ones that will listen
            I come with the heat man, I swear I’m never missing
            And I’m still the same and I swear I’m never switching
            (repeat)

        [ chorus x 2 ]

## Hope that helps!
