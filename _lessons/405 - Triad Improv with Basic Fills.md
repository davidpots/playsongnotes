## Editor's notes

Hey there, friends! In this lesson I'm excited to share a fun 8-measure riff, which came out of me practicing "The Weight" by The Band. While working out the basic A-C#m-D-A chord progression of that song, I found myself exploring triad chord voicings -- and took things even further by coming up with a few original licks n' fills to fill in the gaps. An hour later, I had worked out this original riff -- which I had a blast settling into. I think you'll dig it, so let's check it out!
