Hey there friends! Quick Q&A video today, where I answer the question of how to practice guitar when one of your hands is injured. This came up in two separate Patreon messages that I answered back-to-back... and after thinking about it, I wanted to share a few thoughts that came to mind. I actually broke my wrist in spring 2021, so was very much in this situation myself back then!

Give my video a quick watch if you're curious to hear my thoughts! Ultimately, I think it comes down to finding ways to practice with your healthy hand (whether left or right)... provided you can do this without aggravating your injury.

Finally, let me clarify: I'm not a doctor! Please don't take any of this as medical advice. Please listen to your doctor/provider/therapist/caregiver, as they know more than I do. And as I say at the end of the video, please give yourself the time to fully heal!
