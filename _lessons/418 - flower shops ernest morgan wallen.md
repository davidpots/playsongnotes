## Editor's notes

Hey friends! New music pick for you today, where I'm sharing a guitar lesson for the song "Flower Shops" by Ernest feat. Morgan Wallen. This song rolled off me during the first couple listens, but after that –– it sunk its teeth in hard, and had me listening on repeat. Musically, it's a slow-paced country duet, steeped in both classic instrumentation (that steel guitar!) as well as songwriting which hits a bullseye when it comes to country lyric sadness. What's more, is these two guys can really sing -- their harmonies on this live acoustic version are understated yet incredibly well performed. Give it a listen!

In my guitar lesson, I'll teach you how to play the intro riff (showing you an easy + advanced way to play it), as well as two different strumming patterns to get you going with things. I'll also break down the short solo Ernest plays in this live acoustic version, which makes fun use of double stops.

## Studio recording

Here's the official studio version of this song. Ernest sings the first verse, and Morgan sings the second. This version has a killer steel guitar, which has so much to the vibe.

## Live acoustic recording

From a guitar POV, this one is a bit more scarce. For example, they don't play the slide in the intro riff, and obviously there's no steel guitar adding flair throughout the song. However, this version does have a nice solo played by Ernest at ~2:10, which is included in my video lesson above! But guitar aside, their singing is great.
