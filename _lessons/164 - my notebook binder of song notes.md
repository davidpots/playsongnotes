In this video I want to take you on a tour through my original binder of printed "Song Notes". This is something I created over many, many hours back in 2002-2003. Around that time I was 2-3 years into my guitar playing, and became obsessed with writing down comprehensive notes detailing each song I had learned on guitar. This was mainly done out of a desire to preserve much of the hard work I'd done in working out certain songs: how I approached chord progressions, tabs, and so forth. While many of these songs had their notes & tabs in other places on the web, I preferred to keep my own copy.  The pages were created in Microsoft Word, saved in the "rich text format" (.rtf) extension.

I eventually took to typing these notes up in a very consistent format, and put them inside laminated sheets within a large binder. I've had this binder ever since. More recently, I been creating print-friendly PDFs to pair with the video lessons I make â€“ but I wanted to show you this relic of my past in case it is of any interest to you!
