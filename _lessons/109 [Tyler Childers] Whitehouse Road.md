## Editor's notes

In this lesson, I'll teach you how to play "Whitehouse Road" by Tyler Childers. This is a great song in drop-D tuning with a capo on the 5th fret - and it only needs 3 chords! I'll teach you the chords, explain the intro riff that Tyler Childers plays, and break down the strumming pattern. I hope you enjoy!

## Recommended Performance of This Song

I'll be basing this lesson off of this solo acoustic performance of the song, which is great -- you can hear so much more intricacy in his guitar work (especially compared to the album version, where the guitar is harder to hear). I absolutely suggest giving this a watch & listen if you're learning this song.
