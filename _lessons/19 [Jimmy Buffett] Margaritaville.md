## Lyrics & Chords

    INTRO

        D (with intro riff)

    VERSE

        D
        ...Nibblin' on sponge cake, watching the sun bake...
        D                                     A
        ...All of those tourists covered with oil...
        A
        ...Strummin' my six-string... on my front porch swing
        A                                          D     D7
        ...Smell those shrimp they're beginning to boil

    CHORUS

            G           A                 D          D7
            ...Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
            G                    A                 D    D7
            ...Searchin' for my--- lost shaker of salt
            G              A                    D    A      G
            ...Some people claim that there's a wo---man to blame
                    A                   D
            But I know... it's nobody's fault

        Don't know the reason... stayed here all season
        Nothing is sure but this brand new tattoo
        But it's a real beauty... a Mexican cutie
        How it got here, I haven't a clue

            Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
            Searchin' for my... lost shaker of salt
            Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
            Now I think... hell, it could be my fault

        I blew out my flip-flop... stepped on a pop-top
        Cut my heel had to cruise on back home
        But there's booze in the blender... and soon it will render
        That frozen concoction that helps me hang on

            Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
            Searchin' for my... lost shaker of salt
            Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
            But I know... it's my own damn fault... yes and,

            Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
            And I know... it's my own damn fault

## Chords used

This song needs only three chords. They are:

    ----0----   ----2----   ----0----
    ----2----   ----3----   ----0----
    ----2----   ----2----   ----1----
    ----2----   ----0----   ----2----
        D           G           A

While you can add variations to the above chords as you please, the most common variations you'll want to practice are these:

    ----0----   ----3----
    ----2----   ----2----
    ----0----   ----2----
    ----2----   ----2----
        D7          D7

## Strumming Pattern

At the very least, you'll want to emphasize the 2nd and 4th beat:

        _       _  
        D       D   
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &

Taking it a step further, use the common D-DU-UDU pattern, while continuing to emphasize the 2nd and 4th beat.

        _       _
    D   D U   U D U
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &

Finally, you can add a chunky muted strum to the 2nd and 4th beat. These continue to be down-strums, but are further emphasized via the chunky & muted strum.

        _       _
    D   x U   U x U
    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &

## Intro tab

Here's the tab of the intro melody. Note, I'm also showing the implied chords to be played with each measure. I recommend you move your hands into these chord positions first, and figure out how to play the melodic notes second.

    ---0--0--0-----0-----0--0--0-----0------2--2--2--0------------
    ---2--------3--------3--------3---------0-----------3-----2---
    ---2-----------------2------------------1-----------------2---
    ---2-----------------0------------------2-----------------2---
       D                 G                  A                 D

                                      ...then, stay on D for a bit
