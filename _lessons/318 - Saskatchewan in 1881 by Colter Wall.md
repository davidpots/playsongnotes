## Video lesson

I haven't made one yet -- but here's a preview of the PDF I made for this song. Note, my PDF is for a strummed verison of this song -- i.e., it gives you all the chords you need to play along with Colter. It doesn't have the fingerstyle tabs, as I haven't worked that out yet. I'd suggest [this lesson](http://www.banthamlegend.com/Saskatchewan-in-1881/) if you want to learn it fingerstyle, like Colter plays it.

## Audio of me playing this song

Note, this is from a "strummed" version of the song -- so far I haven't mastered Colter's fingerstyle, so the strum version will have to do.

        Mr. Toronto man... go away from my door
            F                F                         F             C       C
        You got my wheat and Canola seed... and you're asking me for more
               G                 G7            C        C
        Better fly 'fore I... produce my forty-four


        C                  C      C                   C7
        I'm just a prairie boy... never meant none no harm
        F               F               F                   C       C
        Spend my day... makin' wages... out on the Martin's farm
           G                 G7             C        C
        No eastern boy... is gonna twist my arm

                F              F              F            C       C
        I ain't kidding now... my old plow is frozen to my mule
                  G            G7               C       C
        I've been livin' on... ice cold rainbow stew


        C                C         C           C7
        Don't be pickin' fights... with no Mennonites
                 F                           F                   F                   C      C
        Don't be raisin' Cain, while they're plantin' grain, and workin' through the night
              G                  G7               C        C
        Gonna let you know... if you ain't acting right

        So, Mr. Toronto man... go away from my door

        You got my wheat and Canola seed... and you're asking me for more
               G                 G7            C        C
        Better fly 'fore I... produce my forty-four
               G                 G7            C        C  [ end on final C ]
        Better fly 'fore I... produce my forty-four
