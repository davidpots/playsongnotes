## Editor's notes

As part of me relisting my song sheets for [Wildflowers](http://playsongnotes.com/lessons/232) and [If I Had a Boat](http://playsongnotes.com/lessons/229), I wanted to make the following instructional PDF to help y'all get a handle on the chord shapes used in each of these songs.

Specifically, I want to call out how the chords each of these songs use allow you to keep some of your left-hand fingers on the same note the entire time. This is crucially important to recognize, as it makes learning the chords a bit easier -- and likewise, makes juggling the chord changes easier as well.

While I do call this out in each individual full-song lesson for Wildflowers and If I Had a Boat, I wanted to make this new PDF to shine a singular, specific light on the topic. The PDF linked below won't teach you these full songs, but it will provide a deep dive into the chord shapes needed for each song. Check it out!

Back in lesson #334 I tackled this same topic, looking at the different ways you can position your left-hand fingers to play the G-major chord. For instance, should you play the G chord's low-E string with your left-middle finger, or left-ring finger? The answer: it depends! It's all about the other chords you're playing. You'll simply want to use a G-major voicing that sets you up for easier chord changes later in the song. See my [full lesson](http://playsongnotes.com/lessons/334) for details, including a link to the Patreon PDF.
