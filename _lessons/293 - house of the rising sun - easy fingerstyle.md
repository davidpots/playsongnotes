## Editor's notes

Hey friends! In today's lesson I'm excited to share an easy fingerstyle version of "House of the Rising Sun" by the Animals -- which includes a brand new PDF covering everything you need to know when playing this song, whether strumming or playing fingerstyle. In my new fingerstyle video, I'll explain a somewhat simplified way to play the distinctive intro riff -- allowing you to capture the sound of the original Animals version but without the difficult "raked" strum.

If you're looking for a lesson on a strumming version of the song, played with a pick -- check out lesson #96 I made a few years ago, where I teach this technique. The new PDF I made applies to both video lessons.

Here's a preview of the PDF:

And here's what I cover in my updated video lesson:

- 0:00 Lesson overview
- 1:45 Chord shapes needed
- 3:22 Chord progression basics
- 4:43 Fingerstyle: learning the basics
- 7:25 Fingerstyle: intro & verse tab
- 12:02 Playthrough of intro & verses
- 13:50 Farewell & final advice

## A quick correction from my older lesson

Some of you might notice, in my older lesson, I technically made a mistake in one part of my chord progression chart. Specifically, at the end of each verse, I showed a short transition from Am-E-Am-E, as opposed to the actual song which goes Am-E-Am-C-D-F-Am-E-A-E. What I originally taught works fine, and allows you to "shorten" the song -- but in this new PDF I wanted to make things a bit more technically correct to what you hear The Animals play
