## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll teach you how to play "Acid Tongue" by Jenny Lewis. Chords, strumming pattern, intro tab, etc – it's all here! This was a very dear song to me back when it came out in 2009 – and I 100% recommend the album of the same name. I hope you dig this lesson!

    VERSE

      G                          C
    I went to a cobbler to fix a hole in my shoe
                D                         C                      G     C  G
    He took one look at my face and said "I can fix that hole in you"
    G                             C
    ...I beg your pardon, I'm not looking for a cure
               D                            C                      G      C  G
    I've seen enough from my friends in the depths of the God-sick blues

    CHORUS

        G                  Am        G    
        ...You know I am a... liar-------
        G                  Am        G
        ...You know I am a... liar-------
        G                  Am        C            G    C  G
        ...Nobody helps a.... liar------------

           G                                   C
    'Cause I've been down to Dixie and dropped acid on my tongue
             D                  C            G     C  G
    Tripped upon the land 'til enough was enough
            G                        C
    I was a little bit lighter and adventure on my sleeve
            D                C                G    C  G
    I was a little drunk and looking for company
         G                                  C
    So I found myself a sweetheart with the softest of hands
              D                    C           G      C  G
    We were unlucky in love but I'd do it all again

        G                       Am         G     
        ...We built ourselves a... fire-------
        G                       Am         G     
        ...We built ourselves a... fire-------
        G                  Am        C        G     C  G
        ...You know I am a... liar-------

            G          C          G/B       Am (let ring)    G   C  G
            ...And you don't know what I've done

        G                         C
    And by the rollin' river is exactly where I was
                 D                    C        G      C  G
    There was no snake oil cure for unlucky in love
          G                           C    
    To be lonely is a habit, like smoking or taking drugs
            D                   C                  G    C  G  
    And I've quit them both but man, was it rough

        G                  Am         G
        ...And now I am...... tired-----
        G                  Am         G
        ...It just made me... tired-----
        G                          Am       G
        ...Let's build ourselves a... fire-----
        G                          Am       C       G    C  G
        ...Let's build ourselves a... fire--------

                        (repeat G-C-G as desired to end)

## How to play the chords

Here's the typical positions used for each of the chords needed in this song:

    E –––3––––0––––2––––0––––3–––
    B –––0––––1––––3––––1––––0–––
    G –––0––––0––––2––––2––––0–––
    D –––0––––2––––0––––2––––0–––
    A –––2––––3–––––––––0––––2–––
    E –––3–––––––––––––––––––––––
         G    C    D    Am  G/B

## Suggested intro chords

In spite of the chord shapes above, I would absolutely recommend learning this 2-finger way of playing a G-major for the intro of this song -- as it makes the switch from G-to-C so much easier. See my video lesson for context. Technically, the C below is a "C/G", but I'll refer to it as a C for simplicity.

    E –––3–––  <= left pinky f.    ––3–––  <= left pinky f.
    B –––0–––                      ––1–––  <= left index f.
    G –––0–––                      ––0–––
    D –––0–––                      ––2–––  <= left middle f.
    A –––x–––                      ––x–––
    E –––3–––  <= left ring f.     ––3–––  <= left ring f.
         G                           C  

Using the shapes above, you can play the intro G-C-G sequence in the intro as follows:

        G           C   G                
    E ––3–––––––3–3–3–3–3–––––––3–––3–3–––
    B ––0–––––––0–0–1–1–0–––––––0–––0–0–––
    G ––0–––––––0–0–0–0–0–––––––0–––0–0–––
    D ––0–––––––0–0–2–2–0–––––––0–––0–0–––
    A ––x–––––––x–x–x–x–x–––––––x–––x–x–––
    E ––3–––––––3–3–3–3–3–––––––3–––3–3–––
        1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
        D       D U D U D       D   D U   

## Strumming pattern

Here's an easy strum to get started with. Establish your tempo (1-2-3-4), and then do downstrums on only the 1 and 3 counts.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D       D      

From there, you can mimic what Jenny Lewis plays through most of the song by doing this. Note, you'll want to keep your accent on the 1 and 3 counts, but you'll want to add a subtle "down up" on the "4 +" counts. See my video lesson for reference.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D       D   D U
    >       >      

For strumming the G-C-G sequence (heard in the intro, etc) -- refer to this mapping. Basically, you'll want to maintain the 1 and 3 accented counts, but you also need an additional up-strum on the first "3 +" count, just before switching to the C. Again, see my video lesson for reference.

    G           C   G
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D       D U D U D       D   D U
    >       >       >       >

## Leaving all strings open during chord transitions

It sounds like, on the album recording of this song, the guitarist is using a technique whereby they're releasing all of their left-hand chord fingers from each chord on the final "down up" strums before each new chord. Specifically, see the sample tab below where the * denotes that I'm picking up all my left hand fingers from the chord - just for the two strums before the next chord comes in. See my video lesson for additional reference.

        G                           *        C                           *

        1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   |  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   
        D       D   D U D       D   D U      D       D   D U D       D   D U   

## Bridge walk-down

Here's how to play the bridge walk-down that happens midway through the song:

    "And you don't know what I've done...""

    E ––3––    –––0––––3––––0––––
    B ––0––    –––1––––0––––1––––
    G ––0––    –––0––––0––––2––––
    D ––0–– => –––2––––0––––2–––– ...let the A-minor ring,
    A ––2––    –––3––––2––––0––––    then return to the G
    E ––3––    ––––––––––––––––––
        G         C   G/B   Am

## Good luck!
