## Editor's notes

Hey friends! New lesson here teaching you how to play a strum-friendly campfire version of "You've Got a Friend In Me", from start to finish. This is a song I first learned the intro to last year ([see my lesson #246](https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/246/)), but knew I needed to return and teach the entire song after several of you requested I do so. As such, I put together this lesson teaching you basic chord shapes, progressions, and strumming patterns needed -- and also show you two new ways to play the intro (one very simple, the other my "secret stash" personal version). This one has been a blast to learn, I hope you enjoy learning it as much as I did!

This version is largely inspired by the Claire Ryann (and her dad) cover that's on YouTube, which is fantastic and I recommend watching. Note, I don't get into the complexities of his fingerstyle technique -- just because they raise the bar of difficulty quite a bit. Where possible, I'm opting for easy / familiar chords, especially during the bridge which I keep as simple as possible.

## Advanced fingerstyle intro (Lesson #246)

Here's my earlier lesson, recorded about one year before my full-song lesson above. This one focuses only on the intro, and aims to fully mimic what's played in the Claire Ryann cover on YouTube. Just note, this one is tricker than my newer video above!

## Strumming

When first learning this song, begin with something simple -- e.g. downstrums on the 1/2/3/4 counts, with the 1 and 3 getting the bass note of whatever chord you're playing. Then do a full strum on the 2 and 4 counts.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +       d = down strum, bass note only
    d   D   d   D         D = down strum, all strings

Then, you can proceed to this full version -- which adds extra up strums on the "+" counts after the 2 and 4:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +       d = down strum, bass note only
    d   D U d   D U       D = down strum, all strings
                          U = up strum
