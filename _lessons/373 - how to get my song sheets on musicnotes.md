Hey friends! Good news: after a very busy few weeks, 60+ of my recently de-listed song sheets are back online & available to you, once again.

{% include youtube_embed.html yt_id = page.yt_video_id %}

A quick summary of what's new (for my "song" PDFs only):

- Each "song" sheet music arrangement is available for individual purchase at Musicnotes.com (who has been a leader in digital sheet music for 20+ years).
- My song sheets all properly licensed (thanks to Musicnotes), which is a necessity to avoid future copyright issues.
- All my non-song PDFs (riffs, theory, techniques, etc) continue to be available on my Patreon page.

## Patreon supporters get 50% off each song sheet purchase!

As a perk to [supporting me on Patreon](https://patreon.com/songnotes), you can get 50% off each song sheet purchase at Musicnotes.com.

- I'm initially pricing all my song sheets at $2.99, before the 50% patron discount.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why are the song sheets only available for individual purchase?

This is a necessity if I want to keep the song sheets available to you all, in a licensed & legally-sound manner. My Patreon page has reached the size where "the old way" (of freely posting them, as one of many Patreon perks for members who support my general efforts) isn't viable because of legal reasons, not to mention the ethics of depriving songwriters of their fair share. But have no doubt – I'm confident that this new arrangement with Musicnotes is a good one that's win-win-win (for me, for you all, and for the rights holders of each song).

### Will your song video lessons remain freely available?

Yes! They're on YouTube, and will stay on YouTube. You can also browse them on my website.

### Does this effect your lessons and PDFs that aren't for songs?

Fortunately, no – my non-song lessons will remain available as-is for free download on Patreon! Those lessons (riffs, techniques, exercises, theory, etc) will continue to be available through my Patreon page. Membership (monthly or annual) gets you access to all those lessons. Because these lessons are for wholly original work, the same copyright issues won't apply.

### Are you going to resume doing new song lessons?

Yes! I'm working on a Beatles song this week, in fact – and will post it this weekend. Now that this new system is setup, I'll resume doing my song lessons regularly.

### When will the song PDFs that remain unlisted be back online?

My goal is to plow through the de-listed songs, getting them back online as soon as possible – hopefully by end of July. I worked hard to create every PDF I've made, and I want those to be available to y'all as soon as possible. Generally, I will re-add the most requested/popular songs first.

### How will this effect your Patreon page going forward?

Not much will change! I absolutely plan on providing regular, on-going value for all of you loyal supporters. I'm excited to explore new offerings (such as backing tracks, full playthroughs of highly-requested songs, tools like Fretmonster, etc) that I can add in addition to my original PDFs, song sheets, and weekly video lessons. Is there a specific type of content you'd like me to add, for Patrons only? Let me know!

### What's the best way to support you?

Honestly, Patreon remains the best way! The support from you all is incredibly helpful, even at the basic tier. It allows me to post, comment, and direct message with all of you – knowing my educational guitar content (and feedback/answers/etc) are going to folks who truly appreciate my lessons.
