Hello, friends! Super excited to share my new lesson for _Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain_, as played by Willie Nelson on his 1975 album Red Headed Stranger. I've gotten lots of requests for this one over the last few years – and am so happy to have this lesson wrapped up & available.

I'll start off teaching the simplest way to play this song (using the E, A, and B7 chords). Then, I'll walk through step-by-step the various ways you can spice things up to capture Willie's guitar playing vibe: alternating bass notes, walk-ups & walk-downs, and more. In my extended version of the lesson (below), I'll even show a simplified way to play the solo – which I had a blast learning over the past week. Please check it out, and I hope you enjoy!

Video lesson timestamps:

- 0:25 Easy 3-Chord Basics
- 3:11 Strumming Patterns
- 6:01 Alternating Bass Notes
- 10:56 Walk-Ups & Walk-Downs
- 15:46 Additional Willie Flourish
- 17:15 How I Play the Solo

### Extended Video Lesson

For current members on my Patreon page, I have an extended video lesson where I tackle a few additional aspects of this song. This includes a deep dive into my version of the solo, which is slightly simplified compared to Willie's version — but still captures the same vibe. This lesson also includes two play-along covers, showing me playing from start to finish. One is with lyrics/chords & my singing, while the other is me playing slowly (without singing) with the verse & chorus tabs on screen.

### Backing Track

I also made two different 5-minute backing track to use while practicing this song. They provide a drum beat using the slight "swing" feel that is hinted at in Willie's recording. There are two tracks, one at 100bpm and the other at 108bpm — both of which you can use while practicing the chords / progression / solo / etc. Nelson's album version has a tempo of 120bpm.
