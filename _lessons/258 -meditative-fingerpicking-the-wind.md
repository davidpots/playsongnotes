## Editor's notes

In this lesson, I'll describe some of the very repetitive (but fun!) exercises I found myself settling into while recently learning "The Wind" by Cat Stevens. Instead of shying away from "playing the same thing over and over," I often embrace it – and use such occasions to intently focus on some of the more subtle aspects of playing: playing at a consistent volume, avoiding string buzz, striving for steady bass note volume, and so forth. I'll show examples of all this, with a few sequences to practice for yourself if you'd like to come along for the journey.

Thanks and enjoy!
