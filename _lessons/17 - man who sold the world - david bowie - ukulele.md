## Guitar lesson

I haven't made one yet -- but please <a href="mailto:play.songnotes@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a> if this is a song you'd like to learn! This will help me bump it closer to the top of the list.

## Ukulele mini-lesson

Here's a video showing how to play the chorus of this song on the ukulele. Note, this was the first video lesson I made after a 2-3 year break... so it's not up to my usual standard with regard to production & presentation.
