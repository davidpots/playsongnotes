## Part 1 - Free Video lesson

In this week's lesson I'll teach you to play Lean On Me, the 1972 classic from Bill Withers. I'll begin by teaching the chords, progression, and basic strum patterns (1:25) before showing how to mimic the iconic piano/vocal melody with your guitar (4:12). Then, I'll take things a step further by showing how you can use filler strums to flesh things out (7:51), before finally teaching the bridge and ending (10:26).

## Part 2 - Chorus Melody & Advanced Rhythm

This extended video includes instruction on playing the chorus melody while strumming (0:16), a demo of my preferred "advanced" strumming pattern (9:12), and how to mimic the percussive sound of the bass during the bridge (14:16).
