## Editor's notes

Here's a "behind the scenes" entry in which I talk briefly about everything I accomplished in 2016: milestones hit, lessons learned, and takeaways for 2017.

In summary, 2016 was the year I came back to making videos after taking an unexpected 2-3 year break. I made 19 new full song lessons between Aprilâ€“December 2016, and plan to keep up this pace for all of 2017. I even plan on adding some smaller, shorter, non-song guitar lessons into the mix as well - so keep on watching in the new year!

Lastly, a big thanks to all my viewers / fans / followers / subscribers. The kind comments you have left & the generous tips some of you have sent truly are humbling & appreciated. Here's wishing you a happy new year!
