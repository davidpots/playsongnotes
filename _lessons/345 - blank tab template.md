## An overview of the 7-page PDF



Hey friends! A few of you have requested blank tab PDFs for you to download and print -- and I'm happy to finally deliver the goods. What I have here is a 7-page PDF, each page featuring a common template for you to print and write up your tabs. Here's the specific templates available within this PDF:

- Page 1: Table of contents
- Page 2: Blank tabs, no time signature (full page)
- Page 3: Blank tabs, no time signature (half page)
- Page 4: Blank tabs in 4/4 time, with 8th notes
- Page 5: Blank tabs in 4/4 time, with 16th notes
- Page 6: Blank tabs in 3/4 time
- Page 7: Blank tabs in 6/8 time

## How to use these templates

To use this PDF, I recommend printing out a few copies of each page and keeping them in a handy spot, close to your guitar. You may notice that certain pages seem way more useful to you (for example, page 2 is probably the most versatile). When you find something you like, I suggest printing many copies of that specific page -- just so you have them handy.
