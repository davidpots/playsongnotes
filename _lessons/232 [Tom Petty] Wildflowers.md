## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll teach you how to play Wildflowers by Tom Petty, from his 1994 album of the same name. I'll be using a capo on the 5th fret (which enables you to sound just like the recorded album version), and I'll carefully explain the chord shapes, hammer-ons and strumming for the verse and bridge sections.

Lesson timestamps:

- 0:00 Playthrough & overview
- 1:26 Capo 5th fret
- 1:53 Chords for intro & verse
- 5:38 Chord hammer-ons & flourish
- 7:28 Strumming the intro & verse
- 13:31 Bridge chords & strumming
- 18:41 Farewell

## Need help learning the chord shapes?

Separate from my full-song sheet music (linked above), I also made this instructional PDF which focuses solely on the chord shapes this song uses during the intro & verse sections. This provides both photos and guitar tabs to help you understand the finger positions necessary -- and the good part is, a lot of your fingers are staying in the same place for all of the chords!
