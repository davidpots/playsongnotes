## Editor's notes

Hey there, friends! At long last & after many requests, here's my lesson teaching you THE WEIGHT by The Band (1968). As usual, I'll break everything down for you step by step, showing you beginner friendly ways to play each part of the song (including the walk-down riff, intro riff, and even the C#m chord) while also going in-depth with some more advanced instruction. This has long been one of my all-time favorite songs, and I'm excited to show you how to play it! Let's get after it.
