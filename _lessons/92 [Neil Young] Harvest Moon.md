## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll show you how to play "Harvest Moon" by Neil Young. This is a beautiful gem of a song. It uses drop-d tuning (I'll explain this), and some very creative voicing of the D-chord. I'll show you the chords needed, explain the strumming patterns, and of course show you tabs for all of the above. I hope you enjoy! This song was a true pleasure to learn.

## Lyrics w/ chords

112 beats per minute, key of D. Drop-d tuning optional.

    See my sheet music for all the lyrics w/ chords included.

## Drop-D tuning

The tabs below assume you've tuned your low-E string down to a "D" note (aka drop-D tuning). See my video lesson for reference here. A quick cheat to do this: use your 4th string (which is also D, though an octave higher) as a reference note. Lower the low-E string until the 6th string sounds the same as the 4th string. Then, you can play a D chord with all six strings (i.e., 000232) and it sounds great!

## My approach to these tabs

The tabs below aren't going to attempt to capture the timing, individual down-strums & up-strums, and other such subtleties. If you're looking for that type of tab, search and you'll likely find what you're looking for ([example](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/n/neil_young/harvest_moon_ver2_tab.htm)). In my opinion, you have to learn the chord shapes (below) and trust your ear. Practice. Listen to Neil Young play this (album version, and live versions). Listen to covers of it. Find a groove and style that works for you.

Ultimately, there are only four main guitar sections needed – and they overlap quite a bit with the chord shapes needed. While it is hard to execute with Neil Young precision, it isn't a lot to memorize. So print this out, write it down, memorize it, take it slow, work out a version that works for you – and most importantly, have fun! For this is a beautiful song and we're lucky to have it.
