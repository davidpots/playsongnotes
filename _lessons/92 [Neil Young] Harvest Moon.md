## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll show you how to play "Harvest Moon" by Neil Young. This is a beautiful gem of a song. It uses drop-d tuning (I'll explain this), and some very creative voicing of the D-chord. I'll show you the chords needed, explain the strumming patterns, and of course show you tabs for all of the above. I hope you enjoy! This song was a true pleasure to learn.

## Lyrics w/ chords

112 beats per minute, key of D. Drop-d tuning optional.

        ........Because I'm still in love with you..... on this harvest moon

## Drop-D tuning

The tabs below assume you've tuned your low-E string down to a "D" note (aka drop-D tuning). See my video lesson for reference here. A quick cheat to do this: use your 4th string (which is also D, though an octave higher) as a reference note. Lower the low-E string until the 6th string sounds the same as the 4th string. Then, you can play a D chord with all six strings (i.e., 000232) and it sounds great!

## My approach to these tabs

The tabs below aren't going to attempt to capture the timing, individual down-strums & up-strums, and other such subtleties. If you're looking for that type of tab, search and you'll likely find what you're looking for ([example](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/n/neil_young/harvest_moon_ver2_tab.htm)). In my opinion, you have to learn the chord shapes (below) and trust your ear. Practice. Listen to Neil Young play this (album version, and live versions). Listen to covers of it. Find a groove and style that works for you.

Ultimately, there are only four main guitar sections needed – and they overlap quite a bit with the chord shapes needed. While it is hard to execute with Neil Young precision, it isn't a lot to memorize. So print this out, write it down, memorize it, take it slow, work out a version that works for you – and most importantly, have fun! For this is a beautiful song and we're lucky to have it.

## Diving into the two main guitar riffs

So, I want to flesh these out a bit to aid you with strumming help. Shown below is how each riff aligns with the rhythmic counting -- mainly, noting where the accented strums should be. Note, you can feel free to insert additional strums as you wish! My advice is to take things gentle, subtle, and conservatively -- this song is one where you don't want to over-do it.

### D-riff #1

This is heard during the intro, during sequence #3, and after each chorus.

    <!-- [ See PDF for tab ] -->

    v = down strum
    ^ = up strum

    e ––––––––0–––––0––––––––––––––9–––––9–––––9–––––9–––
    B ––––––––10––––12–––––––––––––10––––10––––10––––10––
    G ––––––––11––––11–––––––––––––11––––11––––11––––11––
    D ––––––––0–––––0––––––––––––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0–––
    A –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    D ––0––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
        v     v     v              ^     ^     ^     ^  
        1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  

### D-riff #2

This is heard within sequence #2.

    <!-- [ See PDF for tab ] -->

    v = down strum
    ^ = up strum

    e –––––––(2)––––––––––––––––––(2)––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––––––3––3––3––3–––––3–––––2–––––2–––––2––3––2–––
    G ––––––––2––2––2––2–––––2–––––2–––––2–––––2––2––2–––
    D ––––––––0––0––0––0–––––0–––––0–––––2–––––2––4––2–––
    A –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––0–––––0––0––0–––
    D ––0––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
        v     v  ^  v  ^     ^     ^     ^     ^  v  ^
        1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  

## Good luck!
