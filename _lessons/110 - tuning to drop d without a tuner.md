## Editor's notes

In this video I'll show you how to easily tune down to drop-d, without a tuner! This technique lets you do it in literally 10 seconds. I'll explain exactly how to do it, how to use a tuner (along with this technique) to improve your ear, and also explain how to tune back up to standard tuning - also without a tuner.

The chromatic clip-on tuner I show at the end of this video can be bought [at this link](http://amzn.to/2eFvrRp).
