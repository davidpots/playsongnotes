Hey friends – new lesson today diving into Fire and Rain, the James Taylor classic from 1970. This has been one of the most requested songs I've had in the past year, and it's been a joy to learn over the last few weeks. In my video lesson I'll tackle everything you need to play the entire song, showing more-or-less exactly how James Taylor plays things in addition to some simplified options for some of the tricky bits. Even if you only learn the intro riff, there's so much fun to be had with this song. Let's get into it!

- 2:50 Fingerpicking 101
- 5:08 Intro & Verse Chords

Here's a [members-only video](https://www.patreon.com/posts/65504354) showing two full play-throughs of this song, so you can see how it looks & sounds when I put it all together. In the first playthrough (1:04), I'll display the lyrics and chords, while singing along for context. In the second playthrough (4:39), I'll play at a slower tempo without any singing, showing the tabs for each section as I play.

### Fingerpicking Overview: Travis Picking vs. Traditional Fingerstyle

If you're new to fingerpicking guitar and want an overview of different ways your right-hand fingers play the six guitar strings, this lesson is for you. I made it to explain the difference between "Travis Picking" (where your right thumb & index do most of the work) and one-finger-per-string fingerstyle, which is what James Taylor uses here. My video and PDF include some helpful diagrams and example riffs to show you both techniques in action.
