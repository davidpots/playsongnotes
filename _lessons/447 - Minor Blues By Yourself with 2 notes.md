## Description

Hey there, friends! Today we'll be looking at a beginner-friendly blues lesson, where I'll show how adding only 2 special notes can create a dark, bluesy vibe. We'll be using the chords of Am, Dm, and E7 — all played in a typical 12-bar blues progression. This will set the stage, but the real magic will be the bass notes played between each chord (flat third and flat seventh) — which immediately dial up the bluesy vibe we're looking for. The sequence I'll teach is something you can play by yourself, involving bass notes + strums + very basic fills.

In addition to my main tutorial, I've also included a separate video showing a slow playthrough with tabs on screen. A jam track is also included (audio file, you can listen on this webpage) if you'd like to practice & play along on your own. You also can download the jam track for offline practice. I hope you enjoy!

## The Inspiration For This Lesson

The idea for this lesson came from a few places. Most recently, David over on my Patreon page sent over a request for the song _Bridle on a Bull_ by Chris Knight. I'd never heard the song, but immediately recognized the flat-3rd and flat-7th being used in the acoustic bass line. This song also put me in the mindset of the 12-bar blues structure, which it uses throughout. Note, you'll need to put a capo on the 1st fret in order to play along with Chris Knight's recording (using the chords A, D, and E7):

There's also some Colter Wall influence here. Years ago, I did a lesson teaching a riff similar to what's heard in _Kate McCannon_ — which is also in the Key of A minor — and makes heavy use of the flat-7th (both as a passing bass note, and also as the root of the G major chord). Check out that song, as well as [the lesson I made](/lessons/179/) which explores that riff:

Finally, there's the lesson I made looking at how you can add "grit" to your walk-ups and walk-downs with those flat-3rd and flat-7th notes. This video was made shortly after I connected these dots — which really helped me start to recognize the tones wherever they occurred.
