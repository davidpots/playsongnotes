## Editor's notes

Just found this a few days ago, and can't stop watching. Started to play it, here's my progress.

## Day 1: Learn the main 3 chords

Learn the chords on their own.

## Day 2: Simple strum of the main 3 chords

Practice switching, using simple strum. You can also use a simple finger picking arrangement.

## Day 3: Full progression

Keep the simple strum, but now play the full progression.

## Day 4: dial up the strumming a bit

## Day 5: learn the runs
