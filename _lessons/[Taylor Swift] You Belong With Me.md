## Tune down 1/2 step to play along with Taylor Swift

Note that the album version of this song is a 1/2 step below the chords shown below. If you want to play along with Taylor Swift's version using these chords, you'll need to tune your guitar so that E = Eb, A = Ab, etc.

You can still use the chords below and play the song in standard tuning - but note you'll be in a different key than Taylor Swift and it won't sound right if you play along.

## Lyrics w/ chords

    INTRO
        G ... C ... G ... C ...

    VERSE
        G                                                 D
        You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
                                                 Am
        She's going off about something that you said
                                        C
        She doesn't get your humor like I do...

        I'm in the room, its a typical Tuesday night
        I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
        And she'll never know your story like I do...

    PRE-CHORUS
            Am                      C
            She wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
            G                           D
            She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
            Am                              C
            Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
                              D
            That what you're... looking for has been here the whole time

    CHORUS
                             G
                If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
                D                               
                Been here all along so why can't you
                Am                        C (let ring)
                See------ You belong with me-----
                                G   C   G   C
                You belong with me

        Walking the streets with you in your worn out jeans
        I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
        Laughing on the park bench, thinking to myself
        Hey, isn't this easy?

        And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
        I haven't seen it in a while, since she brought you down
        You say you're fine, I know you better than that
        So, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

            She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
            She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
            Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
            That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

                If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
                Been here all along so why can't you
                See------ You belong with me-----
                You belong with me

                Standing by, and waiting at your back door
                All this time how could you not know
                Baby------ You belong with me-----
                You belong with me

    BRIDGE
                                       Am                         C
                    Oh, I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night
                            G                                D
                    I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry
                      Am                               C
                    I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams
                              G                                D
                    I think I know where you belong, I think I know it's with me...

                Can't you could see that I'm the one who understands you
                Been here all along so why can't you
                See------ You belong with me-----

                Standing by, and waiting at your back door
                All this time how could you not know
                Baby------ You belong with me-----
                You belong with me

                Have you ever thought just
                Maybe----- You belong with me-----
                You belong with me
