## Capo on 1st fret...

If you want to play along with the album version, toss a capo on the first fret! Note, in my video lesson I'm not using a capo.

## Chords

Note the optional pinky additions, on the high E-string:

    ---0+3---2+3---0+3---
    ---1-----3-----0-----
    ---0-----2-----0-----
    ---2-----0-----2-----
    ---3-----------2-----
    ---------------0-----
       C     D     Em

## Simple chorus riff (high E string)

Use your pinky on the 3rd fret of the high E string for all the chords, as shown here:

    e –––3–––––––––––3––2––––––––3–––––––––––3––2–––––––––
    B –––1–––––––––––3–––––––––––0–––––––––––3––––––––––––
    G –––0–––––––––––2–––––––––––0–––––––––––2––––––––––––

         1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
         C           D           Em          D

## Lyrics with chords


    VERSE

        C                    Em          D
        Waiting for the time to pass you by
        C                        Em               D   
        Hope the winds of change will change your mind
        C                   Em          D
        I could give a thousand reasons why
              C        Em            D
        And I know you... and you've got to

    PRE-CHORUS

        C                           Em                     D
        Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up, we can stay forever young
        C                           Em            D
        Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola, underneath the rising sun
        C                   Em          D
        I could give a thousand reasons why
                    C     Em         D  
        But you're going... and you know that

    CHORUS
                                  C      D            Em        D
            All you have to do is stay a minute, just take your time
                C        D           Em     (D)
            The clock is ticking, so stay...
                                  C      D            Em       D   
            All you have to do is wait a second, your hands on mine
                C        D           Em     (D)
            The clock is ticking, so stay

    BREAKDOWN

            C - D - Em - D

            (no lyrics, but same chords as the chorus)

And so on, and so forth.

## Good luck!
