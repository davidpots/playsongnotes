## Lyrics w/ chords

Key of G, 156 BPM.

            G                              C              D                G
    Well, I woke up Sunday morning with no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
            G                               Em                          D
    And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad so I had one more for dessert
           G                               C                                   G       Em
    Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
           C                  D                C                      D
    Then I washed my face and combed my hair ...and stumbled down the steps to meet the day

        G                                     C                D              G
    I'd smoked my mind the night before with... cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
          G                                    Em                                     D
    But I lit my first and watched a small kid playing playing with a can that he was kicking
           G                                       C                                G         Em
    Then I walked across the street and caught the Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken
                 C               D                  C                   D                G
    And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost somewhere, somehow... along the way

            G                      C                                      G
            ...On a Sunday morning sidewalk I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
                                          D                               G
            'Cause there's something in a Sunday that makes a body feel alone
                                         C                                    G
            And there's nothing short of dying that's half as lonesome as the sound
                                 D                                  G
            Of the sleeping city sidewalk and Sunday morning coming down

    In the [G] park I saw a daddy with a [C] laughing little [D] girl that he was [G] swinging
    And I [G] stopped beside a Sunday school and [Em] listened to the songs they were [D] singing
    Then I [G] headed down the street and somewhere [C] far away a lonely bell was [G] ringing [Em]
    And it [C] echoed through the [D] canyons like the [C] disappearing dreams of yester[D]day

            [G]...On a Sunday morning [C] sidewalk I'm wishing, Lord, that I was [G] stoned
            'Cause there's [G] something in a [D] Sunday that makes a body feel [G] alone
            And there's [G] nothing short of [C] dying that's half as lonesome as the [G] sound
            Of the [G] sleeping city [D] sidewalk and Sunday morning coming [G] down
