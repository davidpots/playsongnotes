## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Many times in the past few months I've used my web tool FretMonster in my YouTube video lessons -- and a lot of you have asked me to give a tutorial explaining different ways to use it. For those who asked, you're in luck! In this video I'll give a quick overview of what it is, how it works, and show a handful of different ways you might use it.

Here's timestamps of what I cover in my video:

- 0:00 Introduction
- 0:42 Quick overview of FretMonster
- 2:37 Basics of "reading" the fretboard
- 7:22 Seeing scale notes & positions
- 10:51 Modifying common chords
- 15:07 Recognizing triads
- 20:20 Recognizing repeating patterns (CAGED)
- 25:09 Adding flourish to chords
- 27:00 Seeing "other" chords in the same key
- 29:45 Farewell & final advice

I say in this video, FretMonster doesn't give you specific instructions (which is something guitar tabs DO give you). Instead, FretMonster gives you a "map" that you can use toward whatever your goals might be. This could include things like:

- Seeing scale patterns on the fretobard
- Identifying the notes in any given key
- Recognizing triads up & down the fretboard
- Finding easy ways to add flourish to any chord you play
- Visualizing the notes in any one key
- Understanding how the chords in any one key are related
- etc

Give it a watch -- I hope it helps! And most definitely, let me know any questions you have. I absolutely want to continue to improve FretMonster into the future (making it easier to use, etc) -- and feedback is great. Thanks!
