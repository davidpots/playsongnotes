## Capo 4th fret!

This lets you avoid scary barre chords. If you want to play the song without a capo, it's in the key of E... transpose everything you see below accordingly.

## Chords with lyrics

    (capo 4)

    C                                    Dm  
    I've been staring at the edge of the water
                    Am                          F
    Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
    C                             Dm
    I wish I could be the perfect daughter
                           Am                         F
    But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

               Am
    .....Every turn I take, every trail I track
               G
    .....Every path I make, every road leads back
               C
    ....To the place I know, where I cannot go
               Fm
    ...Where I long to be

            C                                    G
    See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me...
               Am                  F
    And no one knows... how far it goes
           F                                    G
    If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
                 Am         Fm                                      C
    One day I'll know, If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go
