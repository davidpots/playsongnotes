Hey friends, lesson today showing you how to play Wilder Days by Morgan Wade. This is the fantastic track that opens her debut album Reckless, which came out earlier this year. The intro makes fun use of C and a minified F chord, both of which have you removing & adding your left-middle finger in the same manner. Combined with a driving eighth-note rhythm (divided into repeating clusters of 3 and 5), you get quite a distinctive that makes this song quite fun to play.

Be sure to check out [Morgan's album version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JIqRTKJDVw)! Her voice and the production take it all to another level, on top of the guitar playing. We've had this song playing around the house throughout this past summer, and I'm glad to be able to share this lesson with you.

To accompany this lesson, I recommend looking at my previously released print-friendly PDF (Lesson #388) which dives deep into the Key of C, and everything you need to know when playing songs in that key. I break down various topics, such as the notes & chords in the key; the C-major fretboard map; a bunch of tips on alternate code voicings; and many other tips & tricks. Check it out here:
