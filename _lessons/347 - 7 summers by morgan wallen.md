## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's new a video lesson & PDF chord sheet teaching you how to play the recent country hit 7 Summers by Morgan Wallen. Musically, this song makes some good use of major-7th chords (with the Cmaj7 and Fmaj7 in the intro and verse), mixed in with Wallen's clever word-play and great vocals. I'll show you the chord shapes, progressions, strumming patterns, and a few ways to noodle on the intro (with tabs), in a way that sounds great with a solo acoustic guitar.

If you don't know Morgan Wallen, I strongly recommend checking out his stuff -- specifically via Grady Smith's YouTube videos, which do a good job introducing you to & contextualizing the general vibe of his music. This includes some good commentary on Wallen's cover of Jason Isbell's Cover Me Up, which Isbell praised him for. [Here's one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_mcQHU_GyY) of Grady Smith's videos on Wallen – see below for even more.

## Intro tabs

Here's a few ways I like to play the intro riff! For the Cmaj7, I know others teach it further up the next, but I like the practical versions shown here. For the Fmaj7, I've included two filler riffs which you can optionally during those two measures (see my video lesson for reference).

    See PDF for the tab.
