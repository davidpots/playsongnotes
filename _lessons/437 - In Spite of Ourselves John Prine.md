Today we'll learn _In Spite of Ourselves_, the classic John Prine duet that he recorded with Iris DeMent (1999). I'll start off by showing you campfire chords & strumming, allowing you to play this song even if you're just getting started with guitar. From there, I'll pile on a few additional tricks (e.g. strumming with alternate bass notes) before diving headlong into the Travis Picking fingerstyle used in the song's intro. This passage took me a while to learn, but with time and persistence, I got over the hump! And I'm sure you can learn it just the same. Enjoy!
