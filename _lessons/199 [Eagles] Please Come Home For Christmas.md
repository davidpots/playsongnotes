## Backing track

You can currently find the backing track here. Note, this is only the first verse - looping over and over. The idea is to let you practice your chords, strumming, etc - with a steady background track to have on for reference.

## Time signature

Understand that this song has 6 counts per each measure. I'll explain more about this later (within strumming section), but it's important to understand when looking at the chord progression - and understanding how long you stay on each chord.

## Chord progressions

    | A           | C#7         | F#m   (E)   | D     D#°   |
    | A     F#m   | B7    E7    | A           | E+          |

    | A     F#m   | B7    E7    | A           | D           | A

                                    ...let final "A" chord ring

## Strumming

If you want to keep things as simple as possible, try doing a single down strum on the 1 and 4 counts (or, only the 1 count). I recommend doing this, with the song or backing track on in the background, to get a feel for the pulse of the song.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 +
    D           D

Next, start moving your strumming hand regularly within the rhythm  of the 6 counts per each measure. The important thing, though, is to place accent on the 1 and 4 counts (all other strums can be light, delicate brushes upon each string).

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 +
    D   D   D   D   D   D
    >           >

You can then bring in up-strums. One way is to add a "down-up-down-up" after each heavy "down" that happens on the 1 and 4 count.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 +
    D   D U D U D   D U D U
    >           >

Finally, here's one example of one additional way you can add some variety to the strum. I demonstrate this in the video lesson - it isn't easy, but is just one example of how you can make a strumming pattern your own.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 +
    D     U D   D   D U D U
    >           >
