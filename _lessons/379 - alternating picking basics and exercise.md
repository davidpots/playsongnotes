## Editor's notes

Hey friends! New lesson today on alternate picking - an essential strumming technique which is invaluable to have in your toolkit. I'll briefly explain the technique, and then walk you step-by-step through an example riff to help you get introduced with the continuous up & down strums, whether strumming or playing bass-line notes. Finally, I'll show you how you can practice this technique over a backing track I created just for this lesson.

## Backing track for this lesson

Here's the backing track I made to accompany this lesson. It repeats one measure each of G-Am-C-D, played at 110bpm. You can also practice your G-major scale improvisation along with this backing track, as I demonstrate in the video above.
