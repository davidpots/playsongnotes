## Video lesson

Here's my lesson on how to play the intro (first 20 measures) -- which is exactly the same chords / progression / strumming used for the verse and chorus sections. This intro tab is available in the PDF linked below. My PDF also includes all the lyrics, with chords inline, if you want to strum along to the entire song.
