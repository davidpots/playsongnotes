## Lyrics

    INTRO

        Dsus2 ... D ... Dsus4 ... D ... Dsus2 D
        Asus2 ... A ... Asus4 ... A ... Asus2 A

    VERSE

        D                                  A
        ...I got my first real six string.... bought it at the five and dime
        D                                  A
        ...Played it 'til my fingers bled.... was the summer of '69
        D                                  A
        ...Me and some guys from school...... had a band and we tried real hard
        D                                  A
        ...Jimmy quit and Jody got married... I shoulda known we'd never get far

    CHORUS

            Bm            A              D                        G
            ...But when I look back now.... that summer seemed to last forever
            Bm            A              D                        G
            .....And if I had the choice........ Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
            Bm                A               D  
            ...Those were the best days of my life
                                                       (...repeat intro)

        (repeat verse + chorus chords for rest of song)

        Ain't no use in complainin'... When you got a job to do
        Spent my evenings down at the drive-in... and that's when I met you, yeah

            Standin' on your mama's porch... you told me that you'd wait forever
            Oh and when you held my hand... I knew that it was now or never
            Those were the best days of my life... back in the summer of '69

    BRIDGE

            F               Bb                  
            ...Man, we were killin' time
                    C                      Bb
            We were young and restless, we needed to unwind
            F          Bb                  C          Bb
            ...I guess nothin' can last forever... forever, no...

        (repeat intro)

        And now the times are changin'
        Look at everything that's come and gone
        Sometimes when I play that old six string
        I think about you, wonder what went wrong

            Standin' on your mama's porch
            You told me it would last forever
            Oh the way you held my hand
            I knew that it was now or never
            Those were the best days of my life

            Oh yeah... back in the summer of '69
            (etc)
