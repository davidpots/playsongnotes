## Lyrics w/ Chords

    VERSE

              Fmaj7                    Cmaj7                Am7
        It's true... that all that you know is all that you are
                          (riff)
        You said that it's all that you want and more
        Fmaj7                             Cmaj7                          Am7
        ...Fuck off and pour another drink-----... and tell me what you think
                         (riff)
        You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
        Fmaj7                                 Cmaj7              Am7
        ...You put your cigarette out on my face... so beautiful...
                      (riff)
        Please, woman don't break your back for me

    PRE-CHORUS

        F               Fm (let ring)
        ...I'll put you out of your mis(ery)

    CHORUS

        Cmaj7
        Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
                  Am7
        I've been waiting on this all damn day (waitin' on this all damn day)
        Dm7
        Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
                 F             Fm (let ring)
        I'm here.... but don't count on me to...

    VERSE

        Stay a little longer if you convince me
        And tell me all the things that you have against me
        Every time we make up, the truth is faded
        Everybody's blind when the view's amazing
        Damn, who are we right now?

        Can we have a little conversation?
        Figure it out with no intoxication
        We carry on, what is our motivation?
        We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
        Maybe we're used to this

        Tell me, what are we to do?
        It's like we only play to lose
        Chasing pain with an excuse
        I love that shit and so do you
        But don't break your back for me

    PRE-CHORUS

        I'll put you out of your mis(ery)

    CHORUS

        Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
        I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waiting on this all damn day)
        Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
        I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

    SOLO
        (use verse chords)

    CHORUS

        Tell me that it's all okay (tell me that it's all okay)
        I've been waitin' on this all damn day (waiting on this all damn day)
        Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
        I'm here, but don't count on me to stay

## Chords needed

Here's how to play the chords used in the song (the way Post Malone plays them). Note, these can be a bit difficult - especially the F, Fm, and Dm7.

    E –––0–––––1–––––0–––––0–––––1––––
    B –––1–––––1–––––0–––––1–––––1––––
    G –––2–––––1–––––0–––––0–––––2––––
    D –––2–––––3–––––2–––––2–––––0––––
    A –––x–––––3–––––3–––––0––––––––––
    E –––1–––––1–––––3––––––––––––––––
       Fmaj7   Fm  Cmaj7  Am7   Dm7

If you want some easier alternatives to these chords, try these out. Much more conventional, limited barre chords, etc. Specifically, the F and Fm chords require only a few strings. Also, the Dm7 is swapped out for a common D-minor chord. The song will still sound just fine if you use these.

    E –––0–––––1–––––0–––––0–––––1––––
    B –––1–––––1–––––0–––––1–––––3––––
    G –––2–––––1–––––0–––––2–––––2––––
    D –––3–––––––––––2–––––2–––––0––––
    A –––––––––––––––3–––––0––––––––––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
       Fmaj7   Fm  Cmaj7   Am    Dm

## Strumming pattern

    1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a
    D       D   D U   U D     U D U

## Chord progressions

Verse:

    Fmaj7  /  Cmaj7  Am7  •riff•     (repeat)

Pre-chorus:

    F  Fm

Chorus:

    Cmaj7  /  Am7  /  Dm7  /  F  Fm
