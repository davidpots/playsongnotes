## Editor's notes

Here's a country-inspired arrangement of Green Day's "Welcome to Paradise" from their 1994 album Dookie. This one is arranged in the style of Tyler Childers, who is maybe my favorite country artist of the late 2010s. Similar to other songs Childers plays, I'm doing this one in the key of D (you can do drop-D as well), and adding some country inspired licks to fully pain the picture.

Here's audio of me playing it:

## Video lesson

My video lesson for this song is coming soon. Meanwhile, here's a tour of the PDF I made:

## Lyrics and chords

Again, note this is all one whole-step lower than one Green Day plays. I'm playing it in this key because it fits the country arrangement I'm doing better. See my video for more context here.

      ...'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
              F            A
      And I'm feeling so alone
