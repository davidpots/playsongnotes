Hey there my friends! Out of the 74 lessons I posted last year (2019), here's a quick rundown of the 12 most popular based on YouTube likes. Be sure to check out my website playsongnotes.com to find all these full videos and the matching PDF chord sheets to accompany each video.

You're now able to search by lesson number on my website, which is a helpful way to quickly track down any of these videos. Links to each song are below. Enjoy, and thanks so much for all the support you all continue to provide!
