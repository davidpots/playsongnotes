## Editor's notes

Hey friends, here's my lesson teaching you how to play the intro sequence to "Sweet Virginia" by the Rolling Stones, from their classic 1972 album Exile on Main Street. I'll be focusing on the first 20 measures, which offer a great sampling of guitar technique: strumming, walking bass notes, little fills, and a few lead riffs you can imitate with a solo acoustic guitar while strumming. I'll break all this down thoroughly in my video. Whether a relative beginner or pretty far along your guitar journey, I trust this will help take you where you want to go.

A quick final note: as per usual, I'm less interested with highlighting every single note that Keith Richards & Mick Taylor are technically playing, in all cases – as this would be quite tedious and miss the forest for the trees, in my opinion. Instead, I'll show you the lay of the land, explain the foundation, and talk about how to approach the intro overall -- so you'll be able to pick it up and run with it, no matter your skill level.
