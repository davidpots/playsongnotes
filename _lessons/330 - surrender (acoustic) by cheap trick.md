## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's a brand new lesson showing you an acoustic version of Cheap Trick's 1978 classic "Surrender". In this tutorial, I'll show you a slightly simplified version of this tune, arranged to work well on a solo acoustic guitar. While the spirit of this song is retained in this version, I'll cut a few small corners -- mainly, changing the key so we'll be using more typical acoustic chords (key of C, and then key of D in the final verse).

Aside from the usual chord shapes, progressions, and strumming tips -- I'll also show you a full tab for the verse & chorus sections, allowing you to play the notes matching the vocal melody while simultaneously strumming the chords. Whether you want to noodle on this, or combine it while singing & fully strumming -- the tabs I provide in my PDF will give you what you need. This is one of my favorite rock songs ever... I hope you enjoy the lesson!

## Lyrics and chords

As stated above and below, this arrangement takes a few small liberties (changing the key, modifying the intro chords, etc) to make this better suited for a more beginner-friendly acoustic version. Take what you like, leave the rest. See my video lesson for reference and how this sounds when played.

## About this arrangement

Of course, this arrangement takes some liberties and is slightly different from the original song in a few ways. Big picture, I'm changing things to the key of C which lets us use easier chords... and also allows us to modulate up one whole step to the key of D for the final verse & chorus. Also, I'm using different voicings for the chords heard in the intro and between each verse... which again is in the name of making things a bit simpler for a basic acoustic version.

## Chord progressions

This song is played at 134 BPM, with four beats per measure. The chord progressions for each section are shown here below, in both the key of C and the key of D (used in the final verse & chorus).

## Video of Cheap Trick's version of Surrender

While my arrangement above is in a different key, this may be still helpful to listen to for context. Quick tip: you can play along with verse #3 of this official version using the "key of C" progression I show above... because Cheap Trick modulates up to the key of C for the final verse (they're in the key of B for verses 1+2).
