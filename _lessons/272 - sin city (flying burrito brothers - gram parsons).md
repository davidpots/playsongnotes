## Editor's notes

Hi friends, here's my initial notes on "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers. I'll probably be recording a lesson for this sometime mid-December 2019, with a PDF to follow. In the meantime, here's my notes.

                  D             A7            G             D

    VERSE
                 D                      A7             D         G
        This old town... is filled with sin... it'll swallow you in
           D                                 A7
        If you've got... some money----- to burn
                D               A7                D                 G
        Take it home... right away... you've got three years--- to pay
            D            A7          D    D7
        But Satan... is waiting his turn

    CHORUS
                     G                  A7                 D
            This old earthquake's gonna leave--- me in the poor house
               G                 D             A7
            It seems like this whole town's insane
                   G              A7        D           G
            On the thirty-first floor... a gold plated door
                   D              A7              D
            Won't keep out... the Lord's burning rain

              D         A7            D             G
        The scientists say... it will all wash--- away
            D                        A7
        But we don't... believe any more
                     D              A7                D           G
        'Cause we've got... our recruits... and our green mohair suits
             D                 A7           D
        So please show... your I.D. at the door

            [ chorus ]

        [ instrumental verse ]

            D              A7                 D            G
        A friend... came around... tried to clean up this town
              D                        A7
        His ideas... made some people mad
                 D              A7             D              G
        But he trusted... his crowd... so he spoke right out loud
             D                A7               D
        And they lost... the best friend they had

            [ chorus ]

    ENDING
                       G              A7        D           G
                On the thirty-first floor... a gold plated door
                       D              A7              D
                Won't keep out... the Lord's burning rain
