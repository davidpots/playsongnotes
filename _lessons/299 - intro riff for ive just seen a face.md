Hey friends - here's my lesson that breaks down the classic Beatles intro guitar riff to "I've Just Seen a Face" (no capo, key of G). While this riff isn't terribly long, I'll go deep on the detail with teaching you how to play it: starting w/ the chord shapes, moving on to the progression, looking at the picking pattern, and then talking about dynamics & accents. I'll also show some options you have when it comes to playing this fingerstyle, using a pick, or using a hybrid approach. And don't forget, if you want to learn the full song -- I have that covered in its own separate video lesson (#298).

Note the PDF chord sheet for this video also includes notes on playing the full song.
