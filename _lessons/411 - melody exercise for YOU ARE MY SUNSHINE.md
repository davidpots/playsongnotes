## Editor's notes

Hey friends! A lesson today where I show the process of working out the melody notes for "You Are My Sunshine", as covered by Johnny Cash in 2003. I'll walk you through things, using the chord shapes for the song (A, D, and E major) as a starting point -- and help you learn how to look for & recognize the melody notes therein.  I would consider this an essential guitar skill, as understanding where to find the melody notes for any song you're playing opens so many doors.

If you like this lesson, check out a similar videos I made looking at [Can't Help Falling in Love](http://playsongnotes.com/lessons/344/) by Elvis Presley and also [Will You Love Me Tomorrow](http://playsongnotes.com/lessons/309/) by Carole King / The Shirelles.
