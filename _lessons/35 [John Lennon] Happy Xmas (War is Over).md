## Editor's Notes

This video is an acoustic guitar lesson for the song _Happy Xmas (War is Over)_ by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. I'll show you how to play it, whether you're looking for simple strum-along version or a more advanced arrangement full of flourishes to capture the melody you hear in the album version. This lesson includes a playthrough, explanation of how to play each chord, overview of the chord progressions needed, strumming patterns -- I cover it all!

## Chord shapes

Here's how to play the chords needed in this song, in their simplest form. In my song sheet (and video lesson) I show the various ways Lennon modifies each of these chords to add a bit of melody to the strumming.

    E |–––0–––2–––0–––2–––0––––3–––
    B |–––2–––3–––0–––3–––0––––0–––
    G |–––2–––4–––1–––2–––0––––0–––
    D |–––2–––4–––2–––0–––2––––0–––
