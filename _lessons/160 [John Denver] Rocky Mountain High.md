            1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a

    VERSE
               D (w/ riff)               Em             C   A
        He was born in the summer of his twenty seventh year
               D (w/ riff)                Em        G   A
        Coming home to a place he'd never been before
                D (w/ riff)                     Em                 C   A
        He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
                  D (w/ riff)                  Em        G   A
        You might say he found a key for every door

            [use same chords for all remaining verses]

        When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
        On the road and hanging by a song
        But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
        It keeps changing fast and it don't last for long

    CHORUS
                    G        A                D
            But the Colorado rocky mountain high
                 G                A           D
            I've seen it raining fire in the sky
                G               A            D                  G
            The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
                  D (w/ riff)        Em    G  A
            Rocky mountain high, Colorado
                  D (w/ riff)        Em    G  A
            Rocky mountain high, Colorado

                [use same chords for all remaining choruses]

    He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
    He saw everything as far as you can see
    And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
    And he lost a friend but kept his memory

    Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
    Seeking grace in every step he takes
    His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
    The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

        And the Colorado rocky mountain high
        I've seen it raining fire in the sky
        You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply
        Rocky mountain high, Colorado

    Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
    Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
    Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
    More people, more scars upon the land

        And the Colorado rocky mountain high
        I've seen it raining fire in the sky
        I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
        Rocky mountain high, Colorado

        It's Colorado rocky mountain high
        I've seen it raining fire in the sky
        Friends around the campfire and everybody's high
        Rocky mountain high, Colorado

        Rocky mountain high, Colorado
                    [repeat as desired to finish]

## A quick note about Drop D tuning

To play this exactly like John Denver (or me, in my video lesson) -- you'll need to be in Drop D tuning. This means, tune your thickest string (low E) down to a D. Everything else stays the same. This does make some (but not all) of the chord shapes you'll need different. I explain all this below.

If you don't want to change your tuning, that's fine - stay in standard tuning, and use the normal chord voicings throughout the song.

## Main riff

Here's the main riff used in the intro, verse, and the end of the chorus. For tips on learning this, see my video lesson. If you can't play this as tabbed out here, you can still play this song - just strum the D / Em / G / A.

    E ––––––2–2–––––2–2––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––––3–3–––––3–3––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    G ––––––2–2–2h4–2–2–2–––––––2–––––––––––––––0–––0–0–0–––0–0–0–––0–0––
    D ––––––––––––––––––––––0h4–––––4–––2–0–––––x–––x–x–x–––x–x–x–––x–x––
    A ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––2–––2–2–5–––5–5–7–––7–7––
    D ––0–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––0h2–2–––2–2–5–––5–5–7–––7–7––
        D                               Em              G       A
        1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a

## Chord Shapes

Here's how to play the chords used in this song. Remember, we're in drop-D tuning so that will change up a few things with the Em and G chords.

    E ––2––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––3–––(0)–––(0)––––––––2––––1––––
    G ––2––––0–––––0––––0––––2––––0––––
    D ––0––––x–––––x––––x––––2––––2––––
    A ––0––––2–––––5––––7––––0––––3––––
    D ––0––––2–––––5––––7––––––––––––––
        D    Em    G    A    A    C

## Strumming

If you prefer to strum, here's a pattern you can use for the entire song. I show it here with the D / Em / G / A for context.

    D                               Em              G       A
    ↓   ↓ ↑ ↓   ↓ ↑ ↓   ↓ ↑ ↓   ↓ ↑ ↓   ↓ ↑ ↓   ↓ ↑ ↓   ↓ ↑ ↓   ↓ ↑
    1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a
    >       >       >       >       >       >       >       >

        >       >       >       >       >       >       >       >
