## Editor's notes

Hey friends! New lesson today teaching you how to play The Housefire by Turnpike Troubadours, from their 2017 album "A Long Way From Your Heart." Turnpike is one of the biggest bands in the Red Dirt country rock scene over the past 20 years, and many of you have requested I teach their songs over the last few years. Honestly, they never really caught my ear until the past few weeks -- all thanks to this song, which 40+ listens later I'm still can't get enough of. The songwriting, vocal delivery, instrumentation, and more all combine for something truly wonderful, far greater than the sum of all its parts. Guitar-wise, it's a rather straightforward song... though I do include tabs for an 8-measure riff letting you imitate the fiddle & harmonica sound heard in the intro. I'll also give some practical strumming tips to help you work up to the "full strum" heard in the album version of this song. Let's get into it, and I hope you enjoy!

## Grady Smith's Turnpike Troubadours overview

One of my favorite music YouTubers is [Grady Smith](https://www.youtube.com/c/GradySmith), who made this video giving an overview of Turnpike Troubadours at the end of 2021 -- when they just announced they'd be returning after an "indefinite hiatus" dating back to 2019. If you're like me and crave context when getting into a new band, you're in luck! Grady's got you covered.

## Related lesson inspired by "Diamonds & Gasoline"

Here's a warm-up exercise ([Lesson #290](https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/290/)) I made showing you an acoustic riff inspired by Diamonds and Gasoline, also by Turnpike Troubadours. While I don't teach that entire song, this may scratch your itch if you're looking for more Turnpike lessons! This lesson includes a instructional PDF available to my Patreon supporters.
