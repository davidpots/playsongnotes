## Editor's notes

Hey there friends! Quick video here showing off some new updates to my website, which allow you to easily browse my lessons by category, genre, decade, and more.

When viewing any lesson on my site ([www.playsongnotes.com](http://www.playsongnotes.com)) you'll notice a list of clickable tags under the title of that lesson. Clicking on any of these tags will show you a feed of all other lessons that have that same tag. This will let you easily jump around my lessons: browsing, exploring, and discovering will all become much easier to do.

In addition, the seach page on my website (www.playsongnotes.com/search) now includes links to many of the most popular tags on the left side rail -- or, if you're on your phone, at the bottom of the page. This lets you easily browse by these same tags directly from the search page, making it even easier to refine your search as you look for songs to play.

Here's a rough rundown of some of the ways I'm categorizing things. View the lessons that match any of these criteria @ [www.playsongnotes.com/search](http://www.playsongnotes.com/search)

I hope you all find this helpful! Again, from any page on my website â€“ a link to the PDF ([via my Patreon page](http://patreon.com/songnotes)) can be found near the top. Said another way: Patreon hosts the PDF files, but my website is definitely where you'll want to search for things.

Thanks all! I hope you have a great weekend. New lesson coming very soon...
