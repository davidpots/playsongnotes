## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's a brand new lesson for the Billy Strings song "Enough to Leave," which several of you wrote in suggesting I check out. While it's easy to associate Billy Strings with virtuoso bluegrass guitar licks played at a breakneck speed -- I appreciate this song for how relatively basic & straightforward it is. A common strumming pattern, standard chords -- and heartfelt lyrics expressing sadness at the sudden loss of two good friends. As per the licks n' fills that Billy's music is known for -- I do teach some of those here, but they're a bit simplified -- just because I can't play exactly like him, and wanted to make this song accessible for all. Beyond that, I'll show you the usual: the chords, the progressions, talk about strumming tips, show tabs for the intro & a few other fills, and then end things with a full play-through.

I hope you enjoy! If you want more Billy Strings, I also did [a lesson for classic song Summertime](https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/279/) that he covered with Marcus King -- where I similarly show relatively simplified versions of the licks and fills he plays.

## Chord shapes

Here's the chord shapes you'll need to play this song. These are ordered by when they appear in the song (e.g., G to Bm to Em is how things begin). For the D, also get comfortable with removing your finger from the thinnest string, to play a Dsus2 (xx0230) which Billy uses a lot.

    E ––3–––2–––0–––0–––2–––0–––
    B ––3–––3–––0–––1–––3–––1–––
    G ––0–––4–––0–––0–––2–––2–––
    D ––0–––4–––2–––2–––0–––2–––
    A ––2–––2–––2–––3–––––––0–––
    E ––3–––––––0–––––––––––––––
        G   Bm  Em  C   D   Am

## Chord progressions

This song is in the key of G and is played at a tempo of 147 beats per minute. Here's the chord progressions used in the verse and chorus sections.

Verse (play this twice):

    G               Bm              Em              Em
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    C               G               D               D
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

Chorus (play this twice):

    D               Bm              D               G
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    Am              D               Am              D
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

## Strumming pattern

To get started, I recommend getting comfortable doing a single down-strum on the 1 and 3 counts. Use this to get familiar with the chord shapes, the transitions, and the overall progressions.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +    
    D       D          "down... down..."

From there, you can move to the "full" strumming pattern -- which is adding an "down-up" on the final two eighth notes of each measure.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D       D   D U    "down... down, down up"

## Simplifying chord transitions with "chordless" strums

A fun trick to use while strumming this song, which actually makes it easier to play -- is to remove your hands from each chord on or just after the "4" count of each measure. You'll want to keep strumming with your right hand – and the final "down up" of each measure will be played with no fingers on the fretboard. This is so your left-hand has an extra eighth note (or two) to get into the next chord's position. See my video lesson for reference.

<!-- G               Bm              Em              Em
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +


C               G               D               D
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + -->

## Runs and fills

Here's some approximated versions of the main riffs, runs, and fills you hear during this song. Note, I'm simplifying all these partially, because I cannot play with the speed or agility of Billy. If you want the full what-Billy-plays tabs check out Lessons With Marcel. Otherwise, I'm here to serve us mortals.

### Intro riff

The intro is 8 measures of E-minor, beginning with a raked strum (from thinnest to thickest string). Start your counting when you play the thickest (final) note of the raked chord. After that, there's a bit of light & free strumming -- with a small riff Billy plays which I show below. Return to an E-minor, and then slowly build up during your final 8 strums before starting the verse.

    Em -->

### E-minor riff (during the verse)

In the first and third line of each verse section, there's a chance to do a quick riff on the second of the E-minor measures you play. There are two versions of this, the first of which is super simple.

### D-riff (walking up to the G)

In the verses, there's a common walk-up Billy does. I play it as follows which is only removes one note from what Billy plays -- but, the note I remove buys you back some time to switch back to the G.
