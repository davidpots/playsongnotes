## Editor's notes

Hey friends! In this lesson I'll show you 12 very common ways the A-major chord can be modified to slightly change up the sound. I'll break down common variations such as Asus2, Asus4, A7, Amaj7, and A/C#... in addition to showing some ways to change up your finger positions to make other variations possible as well (e.g., playing it with a single finger barred on the 2nd fret). Overall, my hope is to demystify many of these common voicings â€“ so that the next time you run into them, you'll be ready.
