## Notes and tabs

### Chords Used

Here's the chords you'll need. When playing the C/B, it may be helpful to only focus on the middle 4 strings (don't play the thinnest E string). If the C/B gives you trouble, you can replace it with a G/B -- which has the same bass note, but omits the 1st fret being played on the B string.

    e-|----3----0----2----0----------0----2-----  ------
    B-|----0----1----3----0-----1----1----1-----  ---0--
    G-|----0----0----2----0-----0----2----2-----  ---0--
    D-|----0----2----0----2-----0----2----2-----  ---0--
    A-|----2----3---------2-----2----0----0-----  ---2--
    E-|----3--------------0---------------------  ------
           G    C    D    Em   C/B   Am   Am6       G/B

### Intro Riff

Here's the most basic way to approach the intro to this song. If you listen closely to the album version of this song, you'll notice a few spots with additional nuance (hammer ons, slides, etc). I'm omitting these just to keep this tab beginner-friendly... but you can obviously add them if you prefer.

    e |------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-
    B |------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-
    G |------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-
    D |------------------|-----2---0-------|-----------0-----|-----------------|-  (x2)
    A |--------0-2-------|-3-----------2---|-------0-2-------|-3-2-0-----------|-
    E |--3-----------3---|-----------------|-3---------------|---------3-------|-
         G                 C                 G                 C       G
         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

### Ending Riff

The very end of the song puts a little spin on the C walkdown, ending on the Am6 (which isn't played in the song before this point). Here's how I play it. As always, listen along to the recorded version for the exact rhythm and strumming pattern.

    e |---0---------0---------2----
    B |---1----1----1---------1----
    G |---0----0----2---------2----
    D |---2----0----2---------2----
    A |---3----2----0---------0----
    E |----------------------------
          C   C/B   Am  ...  Am6

## Strumming

I like to use a basic "Down, down up, up down up" pattern for this entire song. The only place this changes is during the verse walk-downs (C-C/B-Am), where you may want to slightly modify this strum to ensure you pluck the bass note of the C/B (on the 3 count) with a down strum. After this, you can return to the normal strum. I've written this out below.

    Normal strum:                        Walk down strum, back into normal strum:                   
                                         C       C/B      Am
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +                      1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +            
    d   d u   u d u                      d   d u d   d u  d   d u   u d u

    "Down, down up, up down up"          "DOWN, down up DOWN, down up DOWN, down up, up down up"

## Chord Progressions (key of G)

Quick note, in the 3rd and 4th measure of each verse line -- sometimes Bob switches up when he plays the walkdown (C-C/B-Am) vs. when he plays the C-D... it's not always an exact science, based on listening to a few versions of this song. I prefer what I've written, as it consistently swaps between these two variants.

    INTRO     G

    VERSE     "Oh, pirates yes they rob I..."
              | G . . . | Em . . . | C . C/B . | Am . . . |
              | G . . . | Em . . . | C .  .  . | D  . . . |
              | G . . . | Em . . . | C . C/B . | Am . . . |
              | G . . . | Em . . . | C .  .  . | D  . . . |

    CHORUS    "Won't you help to sing..."
              | G  . . . | C . D . | G . . . | C . D . |
              | Em . . . | C . D . | G . . . | C . D . |

    BRIDGE    | Em . . . | C . D . | Em . . . | C . D . |
              | Em . . . | C . D . | Em . . . | C . D . |
