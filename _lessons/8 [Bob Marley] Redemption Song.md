## Chords w/ lyrics

    INTRO
        G (see below for riff)

    VERSE
            G                Em     C      C/B             Am
        Old pirates yes they rob I, sold I to the merchant ships
        Minutes after they took I, from the bottomless pit
        But my hand was made strong, by the hand of the almighty
           G                    Em     C            D
        We flowered in this generation... triumphantly

    CHORUS
                                  G
            Won't you help to sing...
                C        D        G
            .......These songs of freedom
                   C     D        Em
            'Cause all I ever had....
                   C     D        G
            ...........Redemption songs
                   C     D        G       C   D
            ...........Redemption songs

        Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
        None but ourselves can free our minds
        Have no fear for atomic energy, cause none of them can stop the time
        How long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look?
        Some say its just a part of it, we've got to fulfill the book

            Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom
            Cause all I ever had
            Redemption songs
            Redemption songs
            Redemption songs

    BREAKDOWN
                Em ... Em ... C ... D ... (x4)

        Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
        None but ourselves can free our minds
        Have no fear for atomic energy, cause none of them can stop the time
        How long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look?
        Some say its just a part of it, we've got to fulfill the book

            Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom
            Cause all I ever had, redemption songs

    ENDING
           C      D        Em
            All I ever had....
           C      D        G
           .... Redemption songs
           C      D        G
            These songs of freedom
           C      D        G           C   C/B  Am  Am6 (let ring)
            ..... songs of freedom
