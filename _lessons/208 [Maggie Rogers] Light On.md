    VERSE
                    C
        Would you believe me now...
             G                             Fmaj7
        If I told you I got caught up in a wave, almost gave it away
                  C
        Would you hear me out...     
             G                            Fmaj7             
        If I told you I was terrified for days, thought I was gonna break

    PRE-CHORUS
            Am                               G
            Oh, I couldn't stop it, tried to slow it all down
            Fmaj7
            Crying in the bathroom, had to figure it out
                 Am                        G                Fmaj7
            With everyone around me saying, "You must be so happy now"

    CHORUS
                                C                            G
                Oh, if you keep reaching out, then I'll keep coming back
                              Fmaj7
                And if you're gone for good, then I'm okay with that
                Am                           G          Em                 Fmaj7
                ...If you leave the light on, then I'll leave the light on

                     C
        And do you believe me now
               G                               Fmaj7
        That I always had the best intentions, babe? Always wanted to stay...
                C
        Can you feel me now
                 G                        Fmaj7
        That I'm vulnerable in oh-so many ways? Oh, and I'll never change

            Am                               G
            Oh, I couldn't stop it, tried to figure it out
                Fmaj7       
            But everything kept moving, and the noise got too loud
                 Am                        G
            With everyone around me saying, "you should be so happy now"

                [chorus]

                Am     G               Fadd9
                ...Oh, leave the light on
                Am               G               Fadd9
                ...Oh, would you leave the light on

                [chorus]

## Intro tab, easiest version

The easiest way to approach this is to put your hands in the chord shapes below, and simply remove & add your left index finger to the 1st fret of the 2nd string.

    E ––0––|–––––––––––––––    E ––3––|–––––––––––––––    E ––0––|–––––––––––––––
    B ––1––|––1–0––1–1––0––    B ––0––|––1–0––1–1––0––    B ––1––|––1–0––1–1––0––  <== left index finger
    G ––0––|––0–0––0–0––0––    G ––0––|––0–0––0–0––0––    G ––2––|––2–2––2–2––2––      used on this string for
    D ––2––|–––––––––––––––    D ––0––|–––––––––––––––    D ––3––|–––––––––––––––      the on/off melody note
    A ––3––|–––––––––––––––    A ––2––|–––––––––––––––    A –––––|–––––––––––––––      on all 3 chords
    E –––––|–––––––––––––––    E ––3––|–––––––––––––––    E –––––|–––––––––––––––
        C                          G                         Fmaj7       

## Intro tab, advanced

Here's the full tab, with the pulsing bass notes.

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –––––1–––––0–––––1–––––1–––0–––––––––1–––––0–––––1–––––1–––0–––––––––1–––––0–––––1–––––1–––0–––––––––1–––––0–––––1–––––1–––0–––––
    G –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0–––0–––––––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0–––0–––––––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0–––0–––––––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0–––0–––––
    D –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    A –3–––––––––––3–––––––3–––––––3–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3–––––––––––3–––––––3–––––––3–––1–––––––––––1–––––––1–––––––1–––1–––––––––––1–––––––1–––––––1–––
       C                               G                               Fmaj7                           Fmaj7
       1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a

Here's the timing chart I used when training my fingers to play their parts independently. I practice this by rhythmically knocking my right-hand thumb and index/middle fingers against a table (or steering wheel, or my pants, etc) until I could do the pattern without thinking about it. Then, I translated it to guitar (with my left hand doing the fretting and chord changes). It was hard, but I got it. If you want to learn this, have patience!

    Melody rhythm => |     O     0     O     O   0     |         O = index finger on
                     | 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a |         0 = index finger off
    Thumb rhythm  => | x           x       x       x   | -->

## Best videos of this song

This is my favorite. Solo acoustic guitar, all shot in one live take, her friends singing the chorus as a group. Released the week before her first album goes out into the world. So happy for her.

There's also her SNL performance which I'll include for fun. Less acoustic, but still good I think:

And finally, here's the Spotify Singles version of this song, which has a great acoustic vibe:
