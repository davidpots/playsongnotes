## Editor's notes

Hey friends! New video and PDF today, where I teach how you can slide between different chord voicings for any given chord. Using D-major and A-major specifically, I take 3 different ways to play each of these chords -- and show how you can slide "up" to each position using your left hand. This sliding technique is itself one that sounds cool & adds some distinction to your playing. Even if you want to skip the slides, the chord positions I teach here are good to be familiar with.... as there's more than one way to play any given chord! Be sure to check out my PDF that accompanies this lesson -- as it gives you a handy diagram of the fretboard, showing the 3 shapes in both keys -- plus showing the same shapes in tab form.

## Playing A-major with barred index finger

One concept I use in this video, is that of playing the A-major chord with just one finger (left index, barred across second fret). Here's a video I made showing how to do that! This is a very handy voicing to have in your back pocket, as sometimes using this chord position is advantageous based on context.

Here's my video, and be sure to check out [my written lesson notes](https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/46/) for additional details on this technique.
