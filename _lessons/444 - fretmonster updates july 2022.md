## Editor's notes

Hey there, friends! New updates to FretMonster I wanted to show you all in this quick video. If you've never seen it, FretMonster is an interactive fretboard tool I designed & coded, and it's free to use here on my website. It gives you a dynamic map of the notes on the fretboard based on whatever key and scale you select. It also lets you label & highlight notes however you choose (e.g. showing note name vs. scale degree; showing root note only vs. 1-3-5 triads). A lot of you have wrote in over the last couple years letting me know how helpful FretMonster has been for your guitar journey, so I wanted to give it a long-overdue coat of fresh paint.

New features & updates:

- You can now hide notes on any string, should you want to keep things uncluttered. Simply click on the string label (far left) to toggle a string's view on/off
- You can now use multiple instruments and various guitar tunings. I've added Drop D, Drop G, Cigar Box Guitar tunings, and more!
- Added chromatic scale support
- Added a video tutorial & various related lessons, all linked from the FretMonster page
- Various interaction & visual polish updates

Give it a try! Use FretMonster @ **[playsongnotes.com/fretmonster](http://playsongnotes.com/fretmonster)**
