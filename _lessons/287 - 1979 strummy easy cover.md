                  And I------- don't even     care... to shake these zipper
                  E            Emaj7 B  Asus2
                  Blues... and we don't know... just where our bones

                  Will rest------- to dust, I  guess... forgotten and absorbed... into the earth below

              [Emaj7] [E] ... [Asus2] Double crossed, the vacant and the bored
              [Emaj7] [E] ... [Asus2] They're not sure just what we have in store
              [Emaj7] [E] ... [Asus2] Morphine, city slippin' [F#m7] dues, down to [B] see

                       E              Emaj7 B  Asus2                     E
                  That we------ don't even     care... as restless as we are
                  (E)       Emaj7 B  Asus2
                  ...... We feel the pull... in the land of a thousand
                  E                Emaj7  B  Asus2
                  Guilts------ and poured cement... lamented and

    BRIDGE               B                          C#m     A        B                 C#m      A    
                      Assured to the lights... and towns below..... Faster than,  the speed of sound  
                       B                 C#m        A          F#m         B        E-riff
                      Faster than,  we thought we'd go..... Beneath, the sound, of hope

              [Emaj7] [E] ... [Asus2] Justine never knew the rules
              [Emaj7] [E] ... [Asus2] Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls
              [Emaj7] [E] ... No-a [Asus2] 'pologies ever need be made
              [Emaj7] [E] ... [Asus2] I know you better than you [F#m7] fake it, to [B] see

                  That [E] we---- don't [Emaj7 B] even [Asus2] care... to shake these zipper [E] blues
                  [E] ...That [Emaj7] we [B] don't [Asus2] know... just where our bones,
                  Will [E] rest----- to [Emaj7 B] dust I [Asus2] guess...
                  Forgotten and [F#m7] absorbed... to the [B] earth... [Emaj7] below

              [Emaj7] [E] ... [Asus2] the street heats the urgency of now
              [Emaj7] [E] ... [Asus2] as you see, there's no one [E] around
