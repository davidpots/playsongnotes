## Editor's notes

In this lesson, I'll teach you how to play "Me and Bobby McGee" on guitar. Originally written by Kris Kristofferson, this lesson is more influenced by the Janis Joplin version of the song. This is one of the first songs I learned on guitar! I'll show you the chords needed, the strumming pattern, and explain how to change keys midway through the song.
