## Ring Finger Barre Strength Exercise

In this lesson, I'll show you an approachable 3-string exercise you can use to beef up your ring finger barre chord strength. This is a barring technique you'll need when playing the A-shape barre chord (e.g., x1333x or x3555x) - which can be tough to master! But that doesn't mean it needs to be difficult to learn. With this exercise, you'll be able to have fun with 3 related chords (I-IV-V triads) while focusing on just three strings. This lets you noodle around freely, perhaps work on some picking or strumming exercises, all the while you're building up your ring finger strength. I hope you enjoy!
