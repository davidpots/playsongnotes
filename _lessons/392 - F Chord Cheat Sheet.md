## Editor's notes

Hey friends! In this video I show you 7 "other" ways to play the F chord, none of which require barring all 6 of the strings (which is what the "normal" F voicing calls for). Even though I can play the difficult barred version, in honesty I rarely use it: there are simple many other voicings that get the job done for way less effort. I also want to demystify this chord for those of you who are new to guitar: don't let the F chord scare you away from learning songs! There are easier ways to play the chord which will absolutely get the job done.

In this video I'll go through 8 total versions of F, all based on the first 3 frets. For each I'll explain when to use it, show a picture of hand position, guitar tabs with fingers required, and a fretboard map. My hope is this lesson (and the PDF cheat sheet that accompanies it) will forevermore make F an easier chord to play.
