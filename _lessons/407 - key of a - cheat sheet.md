## Editor's notes

Hey friends! In this lesson I'll give an overview of the Key of A major, and explain to you all the must-know things you'll need as a guitarist playing in that key. I'll explain the notes in the A-major scale, the chords found in the key of A major, common chord progressions, explain the fretboard, and show some common must-know tips that are helpful when playing in this key.

In my PDF, I also link out to all of the song lessons and instructional videos I've made based on the Key of A major. Check it out, and I hope you enjoy!
