## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's a new lesson where I'll teach a quick exercise in the key of E-major, 4 measures total, that uses a cyclical pattern of bass notes -- E to C# to F# to B -- all the while keeping the top 2-3 strings unchanged. I'll break down this particular riff in detail, and also share a handful of other riffs that also use circular bass notes in the same manner.

As I've learned song after song over the years, this is something I'm finally realizing is a constant pattern in some of the riffs –– i.e., keeping the notes on the top 2-3 strings the same, while changing the bass notes in a circular manner. Check out the video & PDF, and I'll show you what I mean!
