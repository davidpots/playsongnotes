## Editor's notes

Hey there, my friends! Quick tutorial today where I show you how I've been creating the custom drum tracks used in some of my recent videos. This is in response to Song Notes member Byron, who asked about this after my latest video teaching [Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay](/lessons/440) by Otis Redding. In my playthrough for that song, you can hear a drum track in the background – which I created using GarageBand's Beat Sequencer tool. While I have next to zero experience as a drummer, I've been able to figure out the process of creating such tracks in just seconds — which I'm excited to share with you in this video.

If you want to try this out yourself, you'll need GarageBand for either the iPad or iPhone ([here's the download link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785)). The great part is, GarageBand is free to download! The Beat Sequencer is just one of the many features included within GarageBand, which is an incredibly powerful tool for amateur musicians.
