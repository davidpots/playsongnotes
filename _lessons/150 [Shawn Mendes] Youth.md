## Chord shapes this uses

Understand these chord positions before you try to master the fingerpicking:

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––5––––5–––––––––––––––
    G ––––4––––4–––––7––––7––––
    D ––––4––––x–––––7––––7––––
    A –––––––––4–––––5––––x––––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––7––––

## Fingerpicking pattern

This is the pattern the entire song uses! Some chords may have your right thumb on the 5th or 6th string, but the essence of this pattern (the timing, the alternating strings, etc) stay the same.

    –––––––––––––––––––––
    ––––x–––––––––x––––––  <-- right middle
    ––––––––––x–––––x––––  <-- right index
    ––––x–––––––––––x––––  <-- right thumb
    –––––––––––––––––––––
    –––––––––––––––––––––
        1 e + a 2 e + a
