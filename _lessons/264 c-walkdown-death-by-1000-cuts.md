## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll show you a fun fingerstyle exercise based on a C-major walkdown progression. Using 2 different arrangements, I'll teach how you can use common chords in the key of C to capture the sound of a descending bass line throughout an 8-measure progression. This is inspired by the guitar work heard in Taylor Swift's song "Death by 1000 Cuts" â€“ though you'll need a capo 4th fret to play along with her song (using the tabs I show).

## The song this exercise is based on

"Death by Thousand Cuts" by Taylor Swift. Again, you'll need to add a capo on the 4th fret to play along with her version. The guitar starts 11 seconds in.
