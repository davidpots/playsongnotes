<p class="large mtl">In this week's lesson, you'll learn how to take an easy-going fingerstyle sequence (Key of G) and dress it up with melodic phrases & fills â€” all coming from the G major scale. The result is a catchy, low-key groove that's easy to jump in to and get running with. This is a terrific exercise if you're interested in learning Travis Picking, or likewise curious about creating your own improvisational fingerstyle arrangements.</p>

## Lead Guitar Study

Here's a quick bonus video, where I take the lead fills from my free video and tackle them on my electric guitar. I also show the process of transposing those same riffs up an octave (out of open position), which is a handy skill that's worth learning. The tabs for this are included in my print-friendly PDF above.

## Jam Track

If you want to play along with a drum track, as I show in my video lesson, you can use this audio file. It loops over a 4-count drumming pattern. Simply press play and jump in at any time... see my video lesson for an example!

## The Inspiration For This Lesson

Michael over on my Patreon page sent over a request for the 1972 classic _Goodtime Charlie's Got the Blues_, a song which I'd never heard before. As I listened to a few different artist's take on it, the easy-going groove sunk its claws into me. While my lesson above doesn't teach the precise heard in this song, I definitely drew some inspiration from this original recording. I've love to teach this song at some point, but in the meantime please enjoy these clips from the original artist and a few others who have covered it.
