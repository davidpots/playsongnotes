## Editor's notes

Hey friends! I recently needed to restring my guitar — and thought it may be helpful to record the entire process, from beginning to end. To be clear, I don't pretend to be an expert when it comes to changing strings or guitar maintenance. Likewise, this isn't a "tutorial" per se. Instead, it's meant to be an honest depiction of what the process looks like for me. Unlike other videos I've made, this one is done in a single unedited take – to help portray how long this really takes.

Here's the timestamps for this video:

- 0:00 Overview
- 1:36 Getting Comfortable
- 3:01  Supplies & new strings I'm using
- 7:30 Removing old strings & pegs
- 13:44 Cleaning the guitar
- 17:16 Putting on the new strings
- 40:50 Tuning the new strings, 1st time
- 45:34 Tuning the new strings, 2nd time
- 47:12 Tuning the new strings, 3rd time
- 50:17 Wrapping up & farewell

My request: if you are any kind of expert when it comes to restringing or guitar maintenance, feel free to send any feedback you have! I'm always looking to learn and improve. Thanks!

## The restringing diagrams I reference in the video

Here's the string tying approach I take in the video:

## A proper tutorial on changing your strings

If you're looking for specific best practices by someone who knows a lot more than me, I recommend this video from Justin Sandercoe:
