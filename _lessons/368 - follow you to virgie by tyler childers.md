## Editor's notes

Hey there friends! New lesson today for Tyler Childer's amazing song "Follow You to Virgie", which is one many of you have requested over the past couple years. This one is hitting hard at the moment, as my wife's grandmother passed away at the beginning of this week -- and we're leaving in the morning to be with family to honor her life. The past few days I couldn't get this song out of my head, and decided to finally jump in and properly learn it. This is a fun one to play -- while it uses mostly just G and C, there's plenty of opportunity to spice things up with little hammer-ons and pull-offs, which you hear right off the bat in the intro. I'll teach it all, and for the intro riff in particular I'll teach it step by step, getting you from zero to hero in 3 different tabs. Let's do it!
