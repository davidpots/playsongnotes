## Editor's notes

Hey friends! In this lesson I'll show you how to use 2-string fretboard patterns to play blues-flavored bass lines using the chords A, D, and E. The best part is, these patterns are repeatable: learn them once, use them in any of the three chords listed above. Whether you want to incorporate this into your strumming or only focus on the bass lines, there's tons of fun to be had. In the end, this makes for a pretty great warm-up exercise to work into your casual guitar playing.
