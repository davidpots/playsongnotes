## Editor's notes

Just starting to learn 1979 after many Patron requests. Practicing it this week (Feb 17), look for the lesson this weekend (Feb 22-23). After my first day of practice, I'd added my initial notes below. More to come...

## Tuning notes

Tune down 1/2 step to play along with the band version. This probably makes the bend you repeat quite often easier to do too, I imagine?

## Day 1 of practice

Keep it simple at first – don't expect yourself to capture the subtle nuance of the droning 6th string, the bend you do in the 3rd measure of the intro/verse, etc.

Start with the bass notes...

    Eb –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    Bb –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    Gb –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    Db –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––7–6––4––2––4––6–––9–9–9–9–––  <= l. ring & middle
    Ab –––6–––6–––6–6–6–––7––––2––2–2–2–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  <= l. index
    Eb –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Then add the octaves and the droning 5th string (second half). Keep the strumming simple! Also, note that I'm not doing the bend yet on the first note of the second half (which later on we'll add on 6th fret of the 4th string).

    Eb –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    Bb –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    Gb –––8–––8–––8–8–8–––9––––4––4–4–4–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    Db –––x–––x–––x–x–x–––x––––x––x–x–x–––7–6––4––2––4––6–––9–9–9–9–––
    Ab –––6–––6–––6–6–6–––7––––2––2–2–2–––0–0––0––0––0––0–––0–0–0–0–––
    Eb –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Then, after many reps and when you're comfortable enough to spice it up, take it all the way (adding the bend, adding the occasionally droning open 6th string , etc).

    Eb –––x–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    Bb –––x–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
