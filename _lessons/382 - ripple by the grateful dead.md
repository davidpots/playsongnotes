## Editor's notes

Hello, my friends - new lesson today on learning the Grateful Dead classic "Ripple" from their 1970 album American Beauty. This has long been one of my favorite songs to play on the guitar, and I'm excited to share it with you. You'll only need G-C-D for a majority of the song, and in this lesson I'll walk you step-by-step to learning the memorable intro riff, which even on a solo guitar can be played in conjunction with the chords you're strumming. Let's get into it!

Video timestamps:

- 0:00 Preview and lesson summary
- 2:27 Chords shapes needed
- 4:13 Verse & chorus chord progressions
- 6:37 Strumming w/ simple bass notes
- 10:49 Strumming w/ alternating bass notes
- 15:24 Intro riff, with tab

## BONUS VIDEO: Full play-along cover

Here's an [additional video lesson]({{page.patreon_lesson_url}}) available to my Patreon supporters only, where I play a beginning-to-end cover of the song, using everything I teach in my main lesson. This video shows the intro tab, lyrics, chords, and strumming patterns on the screen while I play the full song. It's my hope that this video shows you what it realistically looks like to actually perform the song.
