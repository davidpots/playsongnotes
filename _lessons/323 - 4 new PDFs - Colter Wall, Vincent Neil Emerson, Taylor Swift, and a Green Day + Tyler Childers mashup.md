## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's 4 new PDF chord sheets for you, giving you the print-friendly goods for 4 different songs I learned on a family road trip earlier this summer. Instead of waiting until I got lessons made for each of these, I wanted to get these to you ASAP so you can have at 'em in the meantime. The four songs in question:

- Saskatchewan in 1881 by Colter Wall (simplified strum version)
- Manhattan Island Serenade by Vincent Neil Emerson
- Betty by Taylor Swift
- Welcome to Paradise by Green Day (in the style of Tyler Childers)

## Want lessons for these? Let me know which ones!

I plan on making lessons for each of these eventually -- but would love feedback you have on which songs you'd like to see lessons for first. That'll help me prioritize things. <a href="mailto:play.songnotes@gmail.com">Email me</a> and let me know.

## Listen to these songs yourself

### "Welcome to Paradise" by Green Day (in the style of Tyler Childers)

Here's Green Day's version... obviously, the version I put together sounds very different as it's acoustic and uses country-inspired riffs.
