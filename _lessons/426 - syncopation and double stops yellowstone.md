## Editor's notes

Hey there, friends! Today I have a new quick riff lesson, where I take an 8-measure melodic sequence and show how you can use slides, syncopation, and double-stops to spice things up. We're in the Key of C, only using a few chords -- but we'll be jumping in & out of open position (using slides) to underline the sense of movement between each chord.

## Songs from the TV Show "Yellowstone"

As I mention, I came up with this riff while noodling on the guitar between episodes of Yellowstone. Great show, thanks to everyone who suggested I watch it! The music in the show is fantastic. Here's a playlist of all the songs heard in the show, in case interested:
