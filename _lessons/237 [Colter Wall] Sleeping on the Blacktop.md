## Editor's notes

In my lesson above, I show you how to play the intro walk-down as well as the main riff heard in "Sleeping on the Blacktop" by Colter Wall. Note, that I'm playing it in standard tuning with no capo. Colter Wall seems to play this with a capo 2nd fret and his guitar tuned down one whole step. Also, he's adding a bunch of additional notes & fills that I don't teach in my video – just because my aim is to keep it relatively simple and focused. If you want to learn it exactly like him, I would still recommend using my video as a starting point... it'll get you 90% of the way there.

Video timestamps:

- 0:00 Playthrough & overview
- 2:13 Chord shapes needed
- 6:04 Part 1: Walk down
- 9:21 Part 2: Main riff
- 16:21 Farewell

If you'd like to eventually see a full lesson for this entire song, let me know... I might get to it one day. In the meanwhile, I trust this will do you good. Best of luck!

## Other suggested videos

Here's a great solo acoustic performance by Colter Wall – I find these sorts of clips super helpful just to watch how he plays it.

Here's a clip from Hell or High Water, a really great 2016 movie that uses the album verison of this song. I can't recommend this movie enough! Good stuff.
