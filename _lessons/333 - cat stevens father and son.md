## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's a brand new guitar lesson showing you how to play Father and Son, the 1970 from Cat Stevens' 4th album (Tea for the Tillerman). In this lesson I'll explain the chords, talk about the progressions, demonstrate two different strumming options, and then show you a few different ways to play the intro riff (tabs included). Whether you want to keep it simple play it exactly like Cat Stevens -- this lesson has you covered. Thanks for everyone who requested this song, there's been quite a lot of you who have asked for this one recently!
