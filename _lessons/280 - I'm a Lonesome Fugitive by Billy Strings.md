## Lyrics w/ chords

CHORUS
         G              C                   D
    I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
       C                           D        (walk down)
    A fugitive must be a rolling stone
         G                  C                D
    Down every road there's always one more city
        C                D             G
    I'm on the run, the highway is my home

VERSE
                     X               X                X                       
            Well, I raised a lot of Cain back in my younger days
                     X                                    X     (walk down)         
            While my Mama used to pray those crops would fail
                X                  X                X                 
            Now I'm... a lonesome fugitive... with just two ways
                X                               X     (cool riff to end verse)                         
            Outrun the law or spend my life in jail

         X              X                   X                    
    I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
       X                           X        (w/d)
    A fugitive must be a rolling stone
         X                  X                X               
    Down every road there's always one more city
        X                X             C        G          (cool riff to end verse)
    I'm on the run, the highway is my home

    [ instrumental verse ]

                 X                   X                             X     
            I'd like... to take you with me, but can't afford the luxury
                X                          X        (walk down)                      
            Of having one I love to come along
                        X                x                   X                
            Lord, you'd only... slow me down... they'd catch up with me
                X                             D                           
            For he who travels fastest goes alone

         X              X                   X                    
    I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
       X                           X        (w/d)
    A fugitive must be a rolling stone
         X                  X                X               
    Down every road there's always one more city
        X                X             G           (cool riff to end verse)
    I'm on the run, the highway is my home

    [ instrumental verse x3 ]

         X              X                   X                    
    I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
       X                           X        (w/d)
    A fugitive must be a rolling stone
         X                  X                X               
    Down every road there's always one more city
        X                X             G
    I'm on the run, the highway is my home
            X                X                    G
    Oh, I'm on the run, the highway it's my home
