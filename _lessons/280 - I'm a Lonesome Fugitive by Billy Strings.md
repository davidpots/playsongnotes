## Lyrics w/ chords

    INTRO (played with lead riff)
      
          | G   | C   | D   | D   |
          | C   | D   | G   | G   |

    CHORUS
                     G              C                   D
                I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
                   C                           D        (walk down)
                A fugitive must be a rolling stone
                     G                  C                D
                Down every road there's always one more city
                    C                D             G
                I'm on the run, the highway is my home

    VERSE
                 G              C               D              D
        Well, I raised a lot of Cain back in my younger days
                 C            C                      D     (walk down)         
        While my Mama used to pray those crops would fail
            G                  C                D              D  
        Now I'm... a lonesome fugitive... with just two ways
            C             C                 D       D  (cool riff to end verse)                         
        Outrun the law or spend my life in jail

                I'd [G] like to settle [C] down but they won't [D] let me   [D]
                A [C] fugitive must [C] be a rolling [D] stone [D]
                Down [G] every road there's [C] always one more [D] city [D]
                I'm [C] on the run, the [D] highway, it's my [C] home [G]

    INSTRUMENTAL BREAK (played 2x, with solo)
          | G   | C   | D   | D   |

             G                   C                             D        D
        I'd like... to take you with me, but can't afford the luxury
            C           C                 D      D   (walk down)                      
        Of having one I love... to come along
                    G                C                   D            D    
        Lord, you'd only... slow me down... they'd catch up with me
            C              C              D            D                
        For he who travels fastest goes alone

                I'd [G] like to settle [C] down but they won't [D] let me   [D]
                A [C] fugitive must [C] be a rolling [D] stone [D]
                Down [G] every road there's [C] always one more [D] city [D]

                A [C] fugitive must [C] be a rolling [D] stone [D]
                
                [ Played at normal volume... ]
                Down [G] every road there's [C] always one more [D] city [D]
                I'm [C] on the run, the [D] highway, it's my [G] home [G]
                
                [ Played quieter, let chords ring ]
