Hey friends! New song lesson today for the much requested Night Moves by Bob Seger (1976). This song may seem deceivingly simple at the outset (just 3 chords for intro & verse) -- but the rhythm, strumming, and F-chord nuance required makes it a bit trickier to pull off. But, fear not! I'll walk you through it step by step. No matter your skill level, I'll help you both play the F chord (using one of a few options), as well as master the tricky strumming required to capture Seger's sound.

## Related Lessons

Here's a few topics I cover in previous videos which will be incredibly helpful for mastering Night Moves. The first is the percussive strumming technique -- which gives a driving back-beat on the 2 and 4 counts of each measure. This can help you, playing with just your acoustic guitar, imitate the sound of the snare drum in each measure. The other thing that may prove tricky is the F major chord... which I can help you with via my F Chord Cheat Sheet, showing you various ways to play it that don't require the full six-string barre (which isn't an ideal voicing to use in this song).
