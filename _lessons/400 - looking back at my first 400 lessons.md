I recently posted my 400th guitar lesson on YouTube, and wanted to take a quick moment to look back at the long & winding road from there to here!

I started off back in 2013, having just discovered that folks were posting video lessons online. I thought I'd give it a try and quickly posted ~15 videos over a few week period. At the time, this was a fun experiment to me – and nothing more.

A few years later, not having posted anything since that initial batch of uploads – I got the itch again. In 2015 I resumed posting, and a few months later I decided to get serious about posting weekly lessons. I kept at, week after week, and here we are!

I posted my 400th video in November 2021, and as of the time I'm writing this (August 2022) I just posted my 450th lesson. A lot has happened during the last few years: creating PDF downloads for my lessons, building a website, launching membership, etc – and all the while, the train of weekly lessons is cranking along nicely. No plan on stopping.

So, I just wanted to take this moment and look back at the last 400 videos. Reflect on my changing goals, the different eras I went through when it comes to song selection, and other such things. I hope you enjoy the look back!
