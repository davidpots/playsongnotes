## Editor's notes

Hey there, my friends! In this lesson I answer a question from Patreon supporter Bud, who wrote in asking about learning a Chris Stapleton song for an upcoming family wedding. In my video, I give some advice about learning a song for such a performance — which can be summarized as _start with the groove_, and let the details follow. Later in the lesson I'll demonstrate what this means using a portion of the song Bud asked about (Joy of My Life), and show how you can work through the chords, progression, strumming, and even the riff with a groove-first mentality. It's all about _not_ racing ahead to immediately learn the details, which can prevent you from building up a sturdy foundation for the rest of the song.

If y'all would like me to do a full song lesson for for Chris Stapelton's verison of Joy of My Life, let me know.  Bud, I hope this helps — and best wishes to your grandson for his upcoming wedding!
