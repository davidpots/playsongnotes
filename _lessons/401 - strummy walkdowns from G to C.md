## Editor's notes

Hello friends! Today I want to answer a question about combining walkdowns & strumming, sent in by Patreon supporter Gary (thanks for your support!). Specifically, Gary wrote in asking about the Bob Seger song Still The Same, where during the pre-chorus and chorus sections, Seger is strumming G for two full measures -- and at the same time, he's playing a descending run of bass-notes that feels part of the strumming. Gary asked how Seger is doing this, and in this video I'll give an answer -- tabs included!

I'll also show 3 additional tabs (available in my Patreon PDF for this lesson), where I show how this exact same principle can be used in slightly different contexts. Taken together, I hope these examples will help you understand why this technique works so well -- and empower you to use it in your own playing.

### [Wild World by Cat Stevens](/lessons/282) (Lesson #282)

Just before each chorus, there's a walkdown (from G to C) played where Cat Stevens plays each individual string of G/F, G/E, and G/D -- all before resolving to a C-major.

### [Mrs. Robinson by Simon & Garfunkel](/lessons/51) (Lesson #51)

In the middle of each chorus, Simon & Garfunkel employ two different walkdowns back-to-back. One is a walkdown from C to G, and the other is from D to G. While these are different from what I teach in the lesson above, it's the same basic principle at play.

### [I've Just Seen a Face by The Beatles](/lessons/298) (Lesson #298)

In between each line of the verse, the Beatles use a similar walk-down technique in this song. Super fun to play!

### [Key of C Cheat Sheet](/lessons/388) (Lesson #388)

If you need a refresher at the notes in the Key of C, check out this lesson! Any walk-up and walk-down heard in this key uses these notes. This video and PDF also gives a summary of the notes used in each chord within the Key of C, which might help you understand things.

### [Beautiful Fingerstyle Walkdown, Key of C](/lessons/264) (Lesson #264)

Here's a video where I teach a warmup exercise, using a typical walkdown in the key of C. This one is played fingerstyle, adding a beautiful melody via the thinnest 2 strings -- which is played at the same time as the bass-line walkdown.

### [Walk-ups, Walk-downs, and the Fretboard](/lessons/354) (Lesson #354)

A video where I answer a listener question about how walk-ups and walk-downs work, when it comes to how we determine which notes to use. Hint: the notes in any walk-up or walk-down come from the scale of that song's key.
