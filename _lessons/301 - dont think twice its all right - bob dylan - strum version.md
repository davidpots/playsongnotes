## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's my lesson teaching you how to play the Bob Dylan classic "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right". This specific video focuses on a strum-only version of the song; look for my fingerstyle lesson coming in just a few days. Whether or not you want to proceed to the fingerstyle version, this video will help teach you the basics: the chord shapes, the progressions, and some of the walking bass note transitions between various chords. In this video, the beginner-friendly stuff is presented up front (basic chords & strumming), while some more advanced items are saved for the back half.

    HARMONICA BREAK
             C   G7   Am  Am/G  F   F   C   C   C   C

        And it [C] ain't no use in [G] turning on your [Am] light babe... 
        The [F] light I never [C] know'd [G7] 
        And it [C] ain't no use in [G] turning on your [Am] light, babe... 
        [D7] I'm on the dark side of the [G] road [G6] [G7]

            But I [C] wish there was something you would... [C7] do or say
            To [F] try and make me change my [D7] mind and stay
            But [C] we never [G/B] did too much [Am] talking anyway [F]
            But [C] don't think [G7] twice, it's all [C] right

        No, it [C] ain't no use in [G] calling out my [Am] name, gal
        [F] like you never done [C] before [G7] 
        And it [C] ain't no use in [G] calling out my [Am] name, gal
        [D7] I can't hear you any [G] more [G6] [G7]

            I'm [C] a-thinking and a-wondering, [C7] walking down the road
            I [F] once loved a woman, a [D7] child I'm told
            I [C] give her my [G/B] heart but she [Am] wanted my [F] soul
            But [C] don't think [G7] twice, it's all [C] right

        So [C] long---[G]--- honey [Am], babe
        Where I'm [F] bound, I can't [C] tell [G7]
        [C] Goodbye is [G] too good a [Am] word, babe
        [D7] so I'll just say fare thee [G] well [G6] [G7]

            [C] I ain't saying you treated [C7] me unkind... 
            You [F] could have done better but [D7] I don't mind
            [C] You just kinda [G/B] wasted my [Am] precious [F] time 
            [C] Don't think [G7] twice, it's all [C] right


## Chord shapes (basic)

Looking for the easiest possible chords? Here you go! For the F, I've included some alternate versions that don't require the full 6-string barre.

    E ––0–––3–––0–––1–––2–-–0–– –––––0––1–––––
    B ––1–––0–––1–––1–––1–-–1–– ––1––1––1–––––
    G ––0–––0–––2–––2–––2–-–3–– ––2––2––2––2––
    D ––2–––0–––2–––3–––0–-–2–– ––3––3––3––3––
    A ––3–––2–––0–––3–––––-–3–– ––3––––––––3––
    E ––––––3–––––––1–––––––––– –––––––––––1––
        C   G   Am  F   D7  C7    F (alt voicings)

Looking for more complicated chord voicings? Here's what I use and recommend. These are in addition to the basic chord voicings shown above. Many of these work great for Travis-style fingerpicking (e.g., the D7/F# and the F voicing I use).

    E ––1––        ––0––0––        ––x––x––      ––x––        ––x––
    B ––0––        ––1––1––        ––0––0––      ––1––        ––1––
    G ––0––        ––2––2––        ––0––0––      ––2––        ––2––
    D ––0––        ––2––0––        ––2––3––      ––3––        ––0––
    A ––2––        ––x––x––        ––x––x––      ––x––        ––0––
    E ––3––        ––3––3––        ––3––3––      ––1––        ––2––
        G7           Am/G            G6 G7         F          D7/F#     

## Chord progression (basic)

If you're learning this song for the first time, I recommend learning the progressions shown here first. This will help familiarize you with the foundation of the song, upon which you can add plenty of complexity if you wish (which I'll show later). But if all you want is a campfire easy-strum version of the song, this is all you need.

    Verse part 1:
    | C . . . | G . . . | Am . . . | Am . . . |
    | F . . . | F . . . | C  . . . | G  . . . |

    Verse part 2:
    | C  . . . | G  . . . | Am . . . | Am . . . |
    | D7 . . . | D7 . . . | G  . . . | G  . . . |

    Chorus:
    | C . . . | C . . . | C7 . . . | C7 . . . |
    | F . . . | F . . . | D7 . . . | D7 . . . |
    | C . . . | G . . . | Am . . . | F  . . . |
    | C . . . | G . . . | C  . . . | C  . . . |

## Chord progression, slightly more advanced

Same structure as the "easy" version, but with a bit more detail added around bass notes and walking bass lines. I recommend starting with the prior version & getting a grasp of the main foundation, which will make the additional detail shown in this version easier to spot & understand. Whether you strum or play fingerstyle, the progressions shown here will apply.

    Verse part 1:
    | C . . . | G . . . | Am . . . | Am . Am/G . |
    | F . . . | F . . . | C  . . . | G7    . . . |

    Verse part 2:
    | C     . . . | G     . . . | Am . .  . | Am . Am/G . |
    | D7/F# . . . | D7/F# . . . | G  . G6 . | G7    . . . |

    Chorus:
    | C . . . | C   . . . | C7     . . . | C7    . . . |
    | F . . . | F   . . . | D7/F#  . . . | D7/F# . . . |
    | C . . . | G/B . . . | Am .  Am/G . | F     . . . |
    | C . . . | G7  . . . | C      . . . | C     . . . |
