## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll teach you how to play American Girl by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, from their debut 1976 self-titled album. This will be an acoustic lesson, showing you how to emulate the sound of the full-band song with a solo acoustic guitar. I'll teach you how to imitate the intro sound, as well as chords & strumming needed for the verse and chorus sections. There's also a breakdown riff I'll teach which makes for a fun break before picking things back up for the ending. Best of luck, and enjoy!

        ...Raised on promises
        D                    E
        ...She couldn't help thinking that there
              G                    A

                ...She was... an American girl

        Well, it was kinda cold that night
        She was standing alone on her balcony
        Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
        Out on 441, like waves crashin' on the beach

            And for one desperate moment there
            He crept back in her memory
            God, it's so painful, something that's so close
            Is still so far out of reach

                Oh yeah, alright
                Take it easy baby, make it last all night
                She was... an American girl
