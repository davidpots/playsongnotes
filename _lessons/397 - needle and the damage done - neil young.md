## Editor's notes

Hey friends, new Neil Young lesson for you today! This one dives into his 1972 classic The Needle and the Damage Done, the second-to-last track from his album Harvest. This one is a bit challenging, but an absolute joy to play once you've fully learned it. The entire song uses a single chord progression, but Neil puts together an amazingly distinctive riff you hear during the first 8 measures. It will require some mastery of alternate picking and "targeting" specific strings -- but as I said, it's a pure joy to play after you've put in the practice. I'll walk you through everything, step by step (including the verse strumming and the E-fill Neil plays at the end of each verse).
