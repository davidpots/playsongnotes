## Editor's notes

In this lesson, I want to share a recent trick I stumbled on to when playing the D/F# chord shape (spoken as "D over F sharp") - and transitioning from D/F# to either an E-minor or G-major chord. The cool thing about this trick is you'll be keeping your left ring finger on the same exact note for all the chord shapes I show - so, the transitions become much easier. This will be helpful in various different songs that need the D/F# chord shape. Let's check it out!

## How to play the chord shapes

Two things are very important to recognize here. First, understand that your left ring finger will stay on the 3rd fret of the B string for all of these chord shapes. Second, understand that your left index & middle fingers are what's playing all other notes (on the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th string). Together, these two tips make these 4 chords much easier to approach.

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––3–––––3–––––3–––––3––––– <== left ring finger stays here,
    G ––––0–––––2–––––0–––––0–––––     on the 3rd fret, for all four
    D ––––2–––––0–––––0–––––2–––––     of these chord shapes!
    A ––––2–––––0–––––2–––––3–––––
    E ––––0–––––2–––––3–––––––––––
         Em7   D/F#   G   Cadd9

## Exercise 1

The first exercise you may want to try, as part of getting comfortable with these chords, is using a simple fingerpicking pattern. For example, you could use this pattern, which goes uses the 6th, 3rd, and 2nd strings in a repetitive manner. Even though the left-hand chord shapes change, your right-hand picking pattern will stay the exact same.

    E –––––––––––
    B ––––––x––––   <== left middle finger
    G ––––x–––x––   <== left index finger
    D –––––––––––
    A –––––––––––
    E ––x––––––––   <== left thumb

Using this pattern, we could go through the chords in this repeating pattern (Em - D/F# - G - D/F#). Play this as slow as you need to in order to retain consistency... and as you get more comfortable, try speeding it up or altering it as you see fit.

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––––3–––––––––––3–––––––––––3–––––––––––3––––––
    G ––––0–––0–––––––2–––2–––––––0–––0–––––––2–––2––––
    D –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    A –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    E ––0–––––––––––2–––––––––––3–––––––––––2––––––––––
        Em7         D/F#        G           D/F#

## Exercise 2

To take things even further, here's a fun little fingerpicking exercise inspired by the song "Shallow" from the 2018 film version of "A Star is Born". The timing is a bit more tricky here – see my video lesson for reference. The full riff, which repeats, looks like this:

    E  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––0h2p0–––––
    B  ––––––3–––––3–x–3–––––––––––––––––––––––––3–––––––––3–x–3––––––3––––
    G  ––––0–––0–––2–x–0–––––––––––––––––––––0–––––0–––0–––0–x–2––––––––2––
    D  ––––––––––––––x–––––––––––––––––––––2–––2–––––2–––––––x–0–––––––––––
    A  ––––––––––––––x–––––––––––––––––––3–––––––––––––––––––x–––––––––––––
    E  ––0–––––––2–––x–3–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3–––x–––––––––––––
         Em      D/F#  G                 Cadd9           G     D
         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

A tip with this one, if you want some advice: first, practice going between the chord shapes along with the proper rhythmic counting. Here's the same chord positions (minus fingerpicking), with the changes happening at the proper beats:

    E  ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––2–––––––––––
    B  ––3–––––––3–––––3–––––––––––––––––3–––––––––––––––3–––––3–––––––––––
    G  ––0–––––––2–––––0–––––––––––––––––0–––––––––––––––0–––––2–––––––––––
    D  ––2–––––––0–––––0–––––––––––––––––2–––––––––––––––0–––––0–––––––––––
    A  ––2–––––––0–––––2–––––––––––––––––3–––––––––––––––2–––––––––––––––––
    E  ––0–––––––2–––––3–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3–––––––––––––––––
         Em      D/F#  G                 Cadd9           G     D
         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

From there, once comfortable with the timing, you can bring in the fingerpicking and perhaps find it a bit more approachable.

## I hope all this was helpful

Please let me know what other chords you'd like to see lessons made for! In the meantime, best of luck with your playing.
