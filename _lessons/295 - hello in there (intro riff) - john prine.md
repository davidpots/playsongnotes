## Chord shapes needed

Here's the chords you'll need to play this intro riff. Before attempting the fingerstyle riff, be able to play these individually without any issues.

    E ––3––            –––0–––    –––2–––    –––2–––          –––0–––    –––––––
    B ––0––            –––1–––    –––1–––    –––3–––          –––1–––    –––3–––
    G ––0––            –––2–––    –––2–––    –––4–––          –––0–––    –––2–––
    D ––0––            –––2–––    –––0–––    –––0–––          –––2–––    –––0–––
    A –––––            –––0–––    –––––––    –––––––          –––3–––    –––0–––
    E ––3––            –––––––    –––––––    –––––––          –––––––    –––2–––
        G                 Am         D7        Bm/D              C         D/F#

## The right-hand thumb's alternating string technique

After you know the chords, I recommend practicing with your right hand thumb only –– so that you get comfortable alternating bass-note (strings) for each chord, as shown below. You'll literally want to alternate the strings, using the patterns in the tabs I show here, over and over again, whenever you're playing a given chord.

I find it helpful to master this thumb technique first, and even practice going through the progression (e.g., playing along with the song) with just the thumb. Then, when you'll feel like it's under control, bring in the melody notes with your right index & middle fingers. If you try to do everything at once from the outset, in my experience, it makes it far more difficult to learn the song.

    E –––––––––  –––––––––  –––––––––  –––––––––  –––––––––  –––––––––
    B –––––––––  –––––––––  –––––––––  –––––––––  –––––––––  –––––––––
    G –––––––––  –––––––––  –––2–––2–  –––4–––4–  –––0–––0–  –––––––––
    D –––0–––0–  –––2–––2–  –0–––0–––  –0–––0–––  –––––––––  –––0–––0–
    A –––––––––  –0–––0–––  –––––––––  –––––––––  –3–––3–––  –––––––––
    E –3–––3–––  –––––––––  –––––––––  –––––––––  –––––––––  –2–––2–––
       G          Am         D7         Bm/D       C          D/F#

## Chord progression

Here's the chord progressions used in this song. I'm including the chorus here, even though that's not part of this "intro" lesson (the only difference is the inclusion of an F chord, e.g., 133211).

Intro & verse:

    | G      | Am      | D7      | D7      |
    | G      | Am      | D7      | D7      |
    | Bm/D   | Bm/D    | C       | C       |
    | G      | G       | D/F#    | D/F#    |

Chorus:

    | F      | F       | G       | G       |
    | F      | F       | G       | G       |
    | Bm/D   | Bm/D    | C       | C       |
    | G      | G       | D/F#    | D/F#    |
