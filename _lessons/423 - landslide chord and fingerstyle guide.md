## Editor's Notes

Hey there, my friends! In this video I want to dive deep into Fleetwood Mac's classic Landslide, and give you an in-depth overview of both the chord shapes as well as how to go about fingerpicking them. I think you have two options to choose from when fingerpicking this song:

1. Use the *Travis Picking* technique, where your right thumb & right index finger are both alternating strings. Or,
2. Use the *one-finger-per-string* technique, where your right thumb/index/middle/ring fingers are all helping out with the fingerstyle.

I learned this song using the 2nd approach listed above, but in recent years I've been swayed by the Travis Picking technique. Is either technique "correct" in some absolute sense? I don't think so! I believe it comes down to your current skill, capabilities, and preference. If nothing else, my goal is simply to show you both options and let you choose which is right for you.

To accompany this lesson, I've made the instructional PDF (linked above) which provides a 3-page, print-friendly summary of everything I show in the video. Whichever approach you use, it'll provide the chord diagrams + tabs to show how to play each chord needed. Good luck and enjoy!
