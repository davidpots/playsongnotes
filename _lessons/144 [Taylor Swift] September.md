## Chords w/ lyrics

    (capo 6)

           F        C         G
    Do you remember...... the 28th night
          F       C                G
    Of September......... love was changin' the minds
          F        C         G                     F    C     G
    Of pretenders........ or chasing the clouds away

                    F        C           G
    Our hearts were ringing...... in the key that our souls
         F          C                   G
    Were singing................. as we danced in the night
      F             C                     G                        F  C  G
    Remember..................... how the stars stole the night away

        (no chord)
        Ah ah ah...

        F      C       G
        Ahhhhh-------- say that you remember
        F      C       G
        Ahhhhh-------- dancing in September
        F      C       G
        Ahhhhh-------- never was a cloudy day


    My thoughts are with you...... holding hands with your heart
    To see you.................... only blue talk and love
    Remember...................... how we knew love was here to stay

    Now, December..... found the love that we shared
    In September...... only blue talk and love
    Rremember......... the love that we share today

    		Ahhhhh-------- say that you remember
    		Ahhhhh-------- dancing in September
    		Ahhhhh-------- never was a cloudy day

    		Ahhhhh-------- say that you remember
    		Ahhhhh-------- dancing in September
    		Ahhhhh-------- golden dreams were shiny days

    Do you remember... the 28th night of September

    		Ahhhhh-------- say that you remember
    		Ahhhhh-------- dancing in September
    		Ahhhhh-------- never was a cloudy day

    		Ahhhhh-------- say that you remember
    		Ahhhhh-------- dancing in September
    		Ahhhhh-------- golden dreams were shiny days

    		There never was a cloudy day
