## Editor's notes

Hey there, friends! As of today (Jan 12, 2022) the full lesson for this song hasn't been posted yet! I'm finishing it up and it will be available in the next few days. If you want, you can still buy the print-friendly, licensed sheet music (4 pages) linked above.

I did make the practice log video (above), where I show you the live process of working out the melody notes for this song. [Here's a link](http://playsongnotes.com/lessons/411/) to my detailed notes for that lesson, which includes a link to the practice worksheet.
