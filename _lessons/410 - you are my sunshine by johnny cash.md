## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's my new video lesson teaching you how to play the traditional classic You Are My Sunshine. I'm basing this on the 2003 version by Johnny Cash, which is played using only 3 chords (A, D, and E) -- making it great for absolute beginners. In the second half of the lesson, I'll show how you can dial up the difficulty a bit if you want to add more complex strumming (e.g. alternating bass notes). I'll also show two different ways to play the melody riff, tabs included.

I also the practice log video (above), where I show you the live process of working out the melody notes for this song. [Here's a link](http://playsongnotes.com/lessons/411/) to my detailed notes for that lesson, which includes a link to the practice worksheet (which is available to my supporters on [Patreon](http://patreon.com/songnotes)).
