## Lyrics w/ chords

  Opening verses:

             Am              E       Am       Am
      I went down to the St. James Infirmary
        Am         F    E     E7
      I saw my ba---by there
               Am           E          Am     Am
      She was laid out on a cold white table
          F        E         Am     Am
      So cold, so white, so fair

              Am          E       Am         Am
      Let her go, let her go, god bless her
      Am          F       E    E7
      ...Wherever she may be
              Am          E          Am     Am
      She may search this wide world over
                   F            E        Am   Am
      She'll never find a sweet man like me

  Other verses (use same chord progression):

      When I die, bury me in my straight-leg britches
      Put on a box-back coat and a Stetson hat
      Put a twenty-dollar gold piece on my watch chain
      So you can let all the boys know I died standing pat

      An' give me six crap shooting pall bearers
      Let a chorus girl sing me a song
      Put a red hot jazz band at the top of my head
      So we can raise Hallelujah as we go along

      Folks, now that you have heard my story
      Say, boy, hand me another shot of that booze
      If anyone should ask you
      You just tell 'em I've got those St. James Infirmary blues

## How to play the chords

Here are the chord shapes you'll need for this song. A few quick tips. First, for the E7, feel free to play a regular E if the 3rd fret note on the B string gives you trouble. Second, for the F, feel free to sub in any simplified voicing (2 options shown below) if the full F barre chord gives you trouble.

    Typical chord shapes:       Alt. positions for F major:

    E –––0–––0–––0–––1––––      E –––––––––––
    B –––1–––0–––3–––1––––      B –––1–––1–––
    G –––2–––1–––1–––2––––      G –––2–––2–––
    D –––2–––2–––2–––3––––      D –––3–––3–––
    A –––0–––2–––2–––3––––      A –––3–––––––
    E –––––––0–––0–––1––––      E –––––––––––
         Am  E   E7  F               F   F

## Chord progression for entire song

Repeat this, over and over (read left to right, top to bottom).

    Am      E       Am      Am
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

    Am      F       E       E7
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

    Am      E       Am      Am
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

    F       E       Am      Am
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

## Strumming patterns

Simplest way is to do all down strums on the quarter notes (1, 2, 3, 4):

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +         d = down strum
    d   d   d   d

Next, you could bring in a strum of only the root note (thickest string of any chord) on the 1 and 3 counts, followed by a full strum (of all strings) on the 2 and 4 counts.

      A-minor:                E-major:

    E ––––––0–––––––0–––    E ––––––0–––––––0–––  
    B ––––––1–––––––1–––    B ––––––0–––––––0–––  
    G ––––––2–––––––2–––    G ––––––1–––––––1–––  
    D ––––––2–––––––2–––    D ––––––2–––––––2–––   etc
    A ––0–––––––0–––––––    A ––––––2–––––––2–––  
    E ––––––––––––––––––    E ––0–––––––0–––––––  
        d   d   d   d           d   d   d   d   
        1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   

You also could bring in up-strums, which I prefer to do in this manner (note this is an 8 count pattern, which is a bit tougher):

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +       d = down strum
    d   d u d   d u d   d u   u   u       u = up strum
    >       >       >                     > = accented strum

## Adding fills

Here's the fills I demonstrate in my video lesson. These are always played on the final 2-3-4 beats of the 2nd measure (on each of the 4 lines).

Fill #1 of 4

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––0–––
    B –––––––––––––––––––––––1–––
    G –––––––––––––––––––––––2–––
    D –––––––––––––––––––––––2–––
    A ––––––––0–3–––0–––––0––––––
    E ––0–3–––––––––––3––––––––––

Fill #2 of 4

    E ––––––––––––––––––––0–––
    B ––––––––––––––––––––1–––
    G ––––––––––––––––––––2–––
    D ––2–1–0–––––––––––––2–––
    A –––––––––3–0–––––0––––––
    E ––––––––––––––3–––––––––

Fill #3 of 4

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––0–––
    B –––––––1–3––1–––––––––1–––
    G ––0–2–––––––––2–0–2–––2–––
    D ––––––––––––––––––––––2–––
    A ––––––––––––––––––––––0–––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Fill #4 of 4

    E –––3–0––––––––––––––––0–––
    B ––––––––3–1–––––––––––1–––
    G –––––––––––––2–0–2––––2–––
    D ––––––––––––––––––––––2–––
    A ––––––––––––––––––––––0–––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––
