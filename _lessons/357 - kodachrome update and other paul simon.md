## Editor's notes

Hey there friends! I want to share a brand new & updated PDF I made for Paul Simon's Kodachrome â€“â€“ and while I'm at it dive a bit deeper into some other gems when it comes to his guitar playing. This includes my earlier lesson for Mrs. Robinson, as well as a brief look at Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard. I have PDFs for all of these available via the button just above -- and in my video I'll give an overview of each of the print-friendly PDFs I've created for these songs.

## My earlier video lessons

### Kodachrome (lesson \#20):

### Mrs. Robinson (lesson \#51):

ðŸ‘‰ My print-friendly PDF for Mrs. Robinson [is available here](https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/51/).

My beginner lesson, focusing on chords and strumming:

### Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard

This is a song I don't have a lesson for as of now, but my text-only draft PDF (that I show in the video above) [is available here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/49439026) to Patreon supporters. Look for a lesson coming on that eventually!

### The Sound of Silence

This is likewise a song I haven't learned yet, but due to a huge nunmber of requests I've started to learn. Look for a lesson coming very soon (subscribe on YouTube to stay in the loop).
