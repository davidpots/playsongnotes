## Editor's notes

In this lesson, I show you how to play the song "Highwayman" as covered by The Highwaymen in their 1985 release. I'll show you the chords needed, explain the verse, refrain, intro riff, and some handy walk-ups. Chord diagrams and tabs included. This song was originally released in 1977 by Jimmy Webb, then covered soon after by Glen Campbell. Finally, it was in 1985 when the supergroup The Highwaymen (Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, and Kris Kristofferson) made the song quite famous with their version.
