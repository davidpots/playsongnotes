## Editor's notes

In this lesson we're going to have some fun with D-Cadd9-G –– specifically, by applying the same 3-note riff to the high-E string of all of the chords. While this approach ups the difficulty with finger positioning, it results in something that sounds great. Led Zeppelin's "Thank You" and Marshall Tucker Band's "Can't You See" both use a very similar approach to the D-Cadd9-G chords, and this lesson will help get you familiar with some techniques needed to play those songs. I hope you enjoy!
