## Editor's notes

Hey there friends! Here's a lesson teaching you how to play Guy Clark's song "My Favorite Picture of You" – which he released on his final studio album in 2013. This is a great song, with Clark describing the circumstances surrounding a spontaneous Polaroid taken of his wife a few decades ago. Musically, this features fingerstyle guitar played in a very casual manner – primarily focusing on a change from A7sus4 => A7 => Dadd6 => D. I'll explain how to play these chords, and give you plenty of tips on how to go about practicing this chords. In the back part of the lesson, I'll show you the rough tab of how I play things – should you want to get a bit more advanced with it.

Note, you'll need a capo on 2nd fret if you want to play along with Guy Clark's version. Willie Nelson's 2019 cover of this song uses a capo on the 3rd fret.

## Guy Clark's telling of the tale

Here's a short video of Guy Clark telling the story behind this song – i.e., him and Townes Van Zandt were drinking & acting afool, which lead to Clark's wife storming out of the house. Where, chance would have it, a friend with a Polaroid camera was waiting. In this video he also performs the song. It's absolutely not as sharp as the official album cut, but it's still valuable in that it shows how a very stripped back, solo, and minimal performance of this song can still work. Enjoy!

    INTRO (same as verse)

        | A7sus4   A7  | A7sus4   A7   | Dadd6   D   | Dadd6   D   |
        | A7sus4   A7  | A7sus4   A7   | Dadd6   D   | Dadd6   D   |
        | A7           | A7       A7*  | Bm          | E7          |
        | A7           | A7            |


    VERSE #1
        (D)              A7sus4     A7          A7sus4             A7
        .....My favorite picture of you, is the one where you're staring
                 Dadd6    D      Dadd6    D
        Straight into the lens
                         A7sus4    A7           A7sus4        A7
        .....It's just a Polaroid shot, someone took on the spot
           Dadd6         D      Dadd6    D
        No beginning, no end
                    A7                             A7*
        It's just a moment in time, you can't have back
        Bm                      E7                    A7
        You never left but your bags were packed.... just in case

                (use same chord progression for all remaining verses)

    VERSE #2
        My favorite picture of you, is bent and faded
        And it's pinned to my wall
        Oh, and you were so angry, it's hard to believe
        We were lovers at all
        There's a fire in your eyes, you've got your heart on your sleeve
        A curse on your lips, but all I can see... is beautiful

    VERSE #3
        My favorite picture of you, is the one where
        Your wings are showing
        Oh, and your arms are crossed, your fists are clenched
        Not gone but going
        Just a stand up angel, who won't back down
        Nobody's fool, nobody's clown... you were smarter than that

    VERSE #4
        My favorite picture of you, is the one where
        It hasn't rained yet
        Oh and as I recall, came a winter squall
        And we got soaking wet
        It's a thousand words, in the blink of an eye
        The camera loves you, and so do I... click

    ENDING
        My favorite picture of you, is the one where you're staring
        Straight into the lens
