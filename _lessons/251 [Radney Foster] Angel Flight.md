## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll teach you how to play "Angel Flight" by Radney Foster. This song uses the chords of E-A-B-C#m, but is unconventional in the voicing used for each chord. Specifically, we'll be leaving the thinnest two strings open at all times. This not only makes it sound a bit more interesting, but also makes it far easier to play... which is nice! I'll teach you these chords, explain the intro riff (with tabs), and talk about strumming pattern. I Thanks very much to Patreon supporter Dennis for this request.

## Strumming

The main strumming pattern is very straightforward – you'll do all downstrums, on the quarter notes (1 2 3 4). You'll want to accent (emphasize) the 2 and 4 counts, while on the 1 and 3 counts you can get away with only playing the 1-2 thickest strings of that chord. This creates a nice amount of space within the song -- you don't want this one to come off as hectic.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +        D = down strum
    D   D   D   D          U = up strum
        >       >          > = accented strum

If you can manage it, add an up-down-up in the final few counts of every other measure -- as shown below.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +      D = down strum
    D   D   D   D   D   D   D U D U      U = up strum
        >       >       >       >        > = accented strum
