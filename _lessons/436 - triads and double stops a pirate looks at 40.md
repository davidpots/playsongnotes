## Editor's Notes

Hey there, friends! New video in my "Learning Lead Guitar" series, where I share my progress & realizations while getting comfortable playing lead licks, fills, solos, and more. In today's video I'll take a song I've _always_ wanted to be able to play lead fills over... and describe how I realized triads & double-stops could be used to "punch up" the melody line that I was attempting to punch up.

The result is me playing what's recognizable as the "melody" — but it's bolstered by additional notes being played at the same time — all of which help fill out the sound. Double-stops and harmonized 6ths also make an appearance. I'll also explain a realization I had about the multiple places on the fretboard where any given triad can be played — which provides optionality when figuring out how to put it all together.

I also created a backing track, which I use at the end of this video, for you to practice with if you're interested in following along. It repeats the same 12-bar progression over and over (5 minutes total), giving you the perfect playthrough to put all of this into action. If you find this helpful, let me know!
