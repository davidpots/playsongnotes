## Editor's notes

Hey friends! New lesson & PDF today where I walk through the process of learning any difficult song on guitar -- specifically, using a Travis Picking song which requires complicated coordination of right thumb (bass notes) and right index finger (melody notes). This is a style of fingerpicking I've grown to love, but learning songs in this manner can be incredibly difficult. In my video, I'll walk through the step-by-step process I recently used to learn a 17-measure John Prine arrangement that had eluded me for years. Since I finally got over the hump and learned it, I wanted to make this lesson to share my process. This will assuredly apply to any Travis Picking song you might learn in the future.

The arrangement I use in this lesson is inspired by "In Spite of Ourselves" by John Prine.
