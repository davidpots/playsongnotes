## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll teach you how to play a solo acoustic version of "Maybe It's Time," as heard in the 2018 version of the film "A Star is Born". This is a song that only needs 3-4 common chords, which can either be strummed or played via fingerpicking. There's one tricky part of the song, which involves walking down from G to D/F# to E-minor -- which I'll show you how to tackle in two different ways. I hope you find this helpful, check out my lesson for "Shallow" also from this movie.
