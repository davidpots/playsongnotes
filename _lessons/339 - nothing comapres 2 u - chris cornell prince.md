      ...But it'd just remind me of you
      C                                         G/B

## Chord shapes

Here's the tab format for all the chords needed. For the B-flat you can either do x1333x or alternatively go up to the 6th fret and play 688766 (which I find easier, a lot of the time).

    e ––0––––0––––3––––0––––3––––0––––0–––  ––x––––6––  ––x–––1––
    B ––1––––1––––0––––1––––0––––0––––0–––  ––3––––6––  ––1–––1––
    G ––0––––0––––0––––2––––0––––1––––0–––  ––3––––7––  ––2–––2––

## Strumming patterns

Here's the two patterns I recommend learning. The first is this basic pattern, which you can use as a baseline pattern during the verses when singing. It's okay if you occasionally fancy this up, of course -- but this is a good foundation. Remember, 62 beats per minute for the quarter notes.

    1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a
    D       d   d u D       d   d u      "DOWN... down, down-up-DOWN... down, down-up"  (etc)

The fancier strum, which you hear in the first 3 measures of the intro sequence, is as follows. You can also use this during the verse, but don't let this overpower (or distract you from) your singing.

    1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a
    D       d   d u   u d     u d u      "DOWN... down, down-up, up-down... up-down-up" (etc)

## Intro riff

### Simple version

When learning the intro sequence, I recommend starting out with this simple approach where you're not too worried about exact details of rhythm just yet. Big picture, you'll want to get used to the following sequence -- and it's really the Csus4 chord (in the first and fourth measure) which give the distinction to things here.

    [ See PDF for diagram ]

### Full version

Once you have the basic feel of this down (and start to get comfortable w/ the physical switch to & from the Csus4), you can bring in the full strumming. The first three measures will use the "main" strumming pattern, while measure #4 will slightly change things given the chord change that happens (from C to G) midway through the measure. I play it as follows, which I'm pretty sure is how Cornell plays it in the opening of his cover:
