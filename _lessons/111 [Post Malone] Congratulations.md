## Capo 2nd fret!

This will let you use easy chords while still staying in key with the album version of this song.

## Chords needed

The entire song uses only these chords (assuming you have a capo on the 2nd fret):

    E –––––0––––––0––––––
    B –––––2––––––0––––––
    G –––––1––––––1––––––
    D –––––2––––––2––––––
    A –––––0––––––2––––––
    E ––––––––––––0––––––
         Amaj7    E

Without a capo on the 2nd fret, these chords would be:

    E –––––2––––––2––––––
    B –––––4––––––2––––––
    G –––––3––––––3––––––
    D –––––4––––––4––––––
    A –––––2––––––4––––––
    E ––––––––––––2––––––
         Bmaj7    F#

## Lyrics with chords

    Amaj7
    My mama called, seen you on TV
    E
    Son... said shit done changed ever since we was
    Amaj7
    On... I dreamed it all ever since I was
    E
    Young... they said I wouldn't be nothing, now they always say

             Amaj7
    Congratulations... worked so hard, forgot how to
       E
    Vacation... they ain't never had the
         Amaj7
    Dedication... people hatin', say we changed
                E
    And look we made it... yeah, we made it

    (...repeat the Amaj7-E progression for the entire song!)

    They was never friendly, yeah
    Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
    And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
    But I knew I had to have it, yeah
    For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
    Got me itching like a habit, yeah
    I'm surrounded twenty bad bitch, yeah
    But they didn't know me last year, yeah

    Everyone wanna act like they important
    But all that mean nothing when I saw my dog
    Everyone counting on me drop the ball
    Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah

    If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
    How could I make sense when I got millions on my mind?
    Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
    Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes

    My mama called, seen you on TV
    Son... said shit done changed ever since we was
    On... I dreamed it all ever since I was
    Young... they said I wouldn't be nothing, now they always say

    Congratulations... worked so hard, forgot how to
    Vacation... they ain't never had the
    Dedication... people hatin', say we changed
    And look we made it... yeah, we made it

    I was patient, yeah-oh
    I was patient, ay-oh
    Now I can scream that we made it
    Now everyone, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulations
    Young nigga, young nigga, graduation
    I pick up the rock and I ball, baby
    I'm looking for someone to call, baby
    But right now I got a situation
    Never old, been Ben Franklins
    Big rings, champagne
    My life is like a ball game
    But instead I'm in the trap, though
    Pot so big, call it Super Bowl
    Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls
    Top floor lifestyle, Honcho and Post
    Malone, I got a play on my phone, ay
    You know what I'm on, ay
    Huncho Houdini is gone, ay

    (repeat chorus)
