            True love will find you in the end


## Guitar chords used
Here is how you play the guitar chords used in this song. Pretty damn straightforward. You can throw in an Am7 if you like, in place of the Am chord (leave the G string open, and/or add your pinky to the 3rd fret of the high E chord). Otherwise, there is room for feeling in this one -- don't feel too boxed in and just roll with it.
