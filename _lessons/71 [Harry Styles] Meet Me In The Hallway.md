## Notes on my approach to this song

Straight up, this isn't meant to be 100% accurate to how it's played on the album. It's damn close, and these chords will let you play along with the album -- but I have no interest in capturing a perfect record of every single note played on every instrument heard on the studio version (there's too much going on, I'm not good enough, etc). Rather, I want to show you how I enjoy playing this song. If this helps you, fantastic! If you think this is garbage and sacrilege, I emplore you to look elsewhere.


## Chord Progressions

Keeping it super simple here. Again, may not be fully accurate -- but you can get it done w/ these chords.

    INTRO + VERSE

    Em . . . Em . . . A . . . A . . . (repeat)

    CHORUS
