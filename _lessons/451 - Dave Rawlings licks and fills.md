In this week's lesson I'm excited to dive into the guitar stylings of Dave Rawlings, and walk you through three sequences that are filled with licks & fills inspired by his playing. Rawlings' playing style could be described as folk / country / Americana, with heavy doses of bluegrass, gospel, and the blues all mixed in.

His playing often combines loose rhythm with "slippery"-sounding licks, and he's known for embracing dissonance, cross-picking, chromatic runs, and using other bits of related flair — all of which create a truly magical sound. Many of you have requested Dave Rawlings tunes over the last couple years, the most recent request coming Roy (thanks!) who asked that I make a video on his unique style. Here it is... I hope you enjoy!

## The Inspiration For This Lesson

The song that inspired this lesson above all other is "Ruby" by Dave Rawlings Machine — an excellent live version of which can be watched below. Gillian is playing no capo, Key of A... while Dave is playing chords in the Key of G (similar to my lesson) but with a capo on the 2nd fret. Aside from his guitar playing, I just love the full package here (lyrics, full band arrangement, etc).
