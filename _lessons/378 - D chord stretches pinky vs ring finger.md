## Editor's notes

Hi all, quick Q&A video here on the topic of 4th fret stretches to the D-major chord -- and whether it's better to use your left-pinky vs. left-ring finger to reach these 4th fret notes. Patreon supporter Randy wrote in saying he prefers to use the left-pinky stretch when playing Cover Me Up (which I teach in [this lesson](https://playsongnotes.com/lessons/376/)) -- even though I teach it using the left-ring finger stretch.

In summary, you can use either approach! In my video I give an overview of both techniques -- as both have their place! It's all about trade-offs, and picking the proper voicing for the job at hand.

## My lesson focusing entirely on the pinky stretch

Previously, I made [this video lesson](/lessons/167) which focuses 100% on using your left pinky when doing this stretch -- and gives you some general tips on how to get started & up to speed with the technique. Note, this is certainly quite difficult at first! Watch my video, use my practice techniques, and give it time. As your mind & muscles get familiar with things, it'll slowly become more and more manageable.
