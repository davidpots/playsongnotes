## Editor's notes

Lola, by The Kinks, is one of the many fantastic covers that lawyer-turned-guitarist [Mike Massé covers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWWU5x5RLbI) on his excellent YouTube channel. After hearing his version so many times, I decided to work out what he is playing in the intro to the song. While this riff I came up with isn’t 100% what he plays, it’s still a super fun sequence to have fun with. So, I wanted to share! I hope you dig it.
