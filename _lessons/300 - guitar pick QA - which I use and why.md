## Editor's notes

Hey friends! In this video I answer a question many of you have emailed in: which guitar pick do I use? I’ll answer the question, explaining why I use the pick I’ve favored for the past 10 years or so ((Dunlop .46mm “Delrin” 41P.46, light pink)[Dunlop 41P.46 Delrin, Light Pink, .46mm, 12/Player’s Pack https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003KV7UVI/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_zHFTEb5AMG998]) — and why I’ve settled on this pick after experimenting with a few similar ones over the years.

The two main reasons I like the Dunlop .46mm Delrin style pick:

1. It’s flexible enough to create a softer sound on the strings, but not too flimsy as to not let you project individual strings when necessary.
2. It’s material has a nice “grip” on my thumb and index finger, which I find much more helpful than nylon when it comes to keeping control of the pick (and not dropping it).

In the video I'll talk through all this and more, with some visual examples and guitar playing demonstrations to accompany some of the points I make. I hope you find this helpful... thanks to all of you who asked this question!
