## Editor's notes

I recently learned St James Infirmary Blues (check out my lesson for it!) – and as part of learning a few licks & fills for that song, I found myself wanting to continue exploring beginner blues lead guitar. So, I went ahead and made a backing track to practice over. In this resulting entry in my practice log, I'll demonstrate some of my exploration of the minor blues scale (played over the backing track). I'll show you the scale chart I'm using, as well as talk through some of my thinking in getting started with unfamiliar scales.

Remember, you can access the scale chart web tool I built (aka. FretMonster!) at [playsongnotes.com/fretmonster](http://playsongnotes.com/fretmonster)

Additional notes for this lesson coming soon!
