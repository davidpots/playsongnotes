## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll show you how to play an acoustic fingerstyle intro to "You've Got a Friend in Me", the classic song from the Toy Story movies. This particular arrangement is taken from the YouTube cover of this song by Claire Ryann and her dad, who plays this beautifully and makes it look easy. It's only 4 measures, but I'll break it down for you step by step: the left hand chord shapes, the right hand fingerstyle technique, and also show some opportunities to add some advanced rhythm flourish.

    C            G+        C   C7    F               F         C     C7
    You've got a friend in me.......... You've got a friend in me....
    F           C           E         Am
    ...When the road looks.... rough ahead
               F         C               E         Am
    And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
    F             C                E       Am    
    ...You just remember what your old pal said
         Dm           G         C   C7        Dm           G         C
    Boy, you've got a friend in me..... Yeah, you've got a friend in me

    C            G+        C   C7    F               F         C     C7
    You've got a friend in me.......... You've got a friend in me....
    F                C         E               Am
    ...If you've got troubles.... I've got 'em too
    F              C         E             Am
    ...There isn't anything, I wouldn't do--- for you
    F             C              E         Am
    ...We stick together and can... see it through
           Dm           G             C  C7   Dm           G         C
    'Cause you've got a friend in me......... You've got a friend in me

        F             F                B7                         B7
        ...Some other folks might be a... little bit smarter than I am
        C             G+       C      C7
        ...Bigger and stronger too... maybe
        B7             B7           B7       B7
        ...But none of them... will ever---- love you
            Em    A7       Dm     G
        The way I do, it's me and you, boy

    C             G+       C   C7      F               F     C    C7
    ...And as the years go by..... our friendship will never die
    F               F            C    E   Am
    ...You're gonna see it's our des--ti--ny
    Dm           G         C   C7        Dm           G         C
    You've got a friend in me..... Yeah, you've got a friend in me
