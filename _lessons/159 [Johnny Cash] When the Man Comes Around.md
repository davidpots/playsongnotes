## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll show you how to play "The Man Comes Around" by Johnny Cash, including a tutorial for the chords and strumming pattern. This is the first Cash song I fell in love with, back around 2003 on a jukebox in my favorite college bar. I hope you dig this lesson!

## Lyrics and chords

See page 1 of my song sheet for all lyrics and chords, neatly formatted to fit while still being readable. Pages 2-4 give additional guidance on the chords, walk-ups & walk-downs, strumming patterns, and a step-by-step guide to learning the muted C strum used throughout the song.
