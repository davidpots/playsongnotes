## Editor's notes

Hey friends! New lesson today, where I return to Johnny Cash's classic RING OF FIRE, and dive deep into the deceivingly simple rhythm, chord progression, and strumming patterns used in this song. This comes years after my original video lesson for this song, which is very popular -- but has lead to lots of viewer feedback on this exact topic. I'll break down the exact chord progression Cash's album version uses, in addition to showing you a simplified progression chart for the entire song (e.g. if you don't want to carve out time for the mariachi horn sections during the verse). Let's get into it!

Timestamps for this new video:

- 0:00 Overview
- 2:45 Strumming the Intro: Simple Version
- 4:23 Strumming the Intro: Full Version
- 6:33 Strumming the Verse
- 9:44 Strumming the Chorus
- 10:45 The Weird Rhythm in Verse #2 ("I fell for you like a child...")

## BONUS VIDEO: Full Play-Along Cover (Using Both Progressions)

I also made a separate video, available only to my Patreon supporters, where I play through the entire song (start to finish) twice: one using the chord progression heard in Cash's album version, and the other using a simplified strumming pattern that removes the horn sections. Thanks to all of you who support me on Patreon, it makes videos like this possible.

## My original lesson for Ring of Fire

Here's the [original video lesson](/lessons/134/) I made for this song a few years back, which gives a quick overview of things. It also dives into the mariachi horn riff, showing you how to play that while strumming (via solo acoustic guitar):
