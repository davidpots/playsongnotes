## Editor's notes

Here's a guitar lesson showing you how to play "You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go" by Bob Dylan (in standard tuning). This is a great song from the album "Blood on the Tracks," which I love love love. As I note in the lesson, this is likely not how Bob Dylan played (plays) the song -- it's unique arrangement I pieced together myself -- so take it for what it's worth. This lesson includes chords, tabs, and strumming pattern -- with a nice focus on how to emphasize the bass note of each chord as part of the strumming pattern.

    I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before
    E                E          B         B
    ...Never been so easy or so slow
              E               Emaj7               A               A    
    I've been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right it's wrong
    E                    B                 E           E
    You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

    [E] Dragon clouds so [Emaj7] high above, I've [A] only known [A] careless love
    [E] ...It always [E] hits me from [B] below... [B]
    [E] This time around it's [Emaj7] more correct, [A] right on target, [A] so direct
    [E] You're gonna make me [B] lonesome when you [E] go... [E]

    [E] Purple clover, [Emaj7] Queen Anne lace... [A] crimson hair [A] across your face
    [E] You could make me [E] cry if you don't [B] know... [B]
    [E] Can't remember what I was [Emaj7] thinking of, you [A] might be spoiling me [A] too much, love
    [E] You're gonna make me [B] lonesome when you [E] go... [E]

        I could stay with you forever, and never realize the time

    [E] Situations have [Emaj7] ended sad, [A] relationships have [A] all been bad
    [E] Mine've been like [E] Verlaine's and [B] Rimbaud... [B]
    But [E] there's no way I [Emaj7] can compare, [A] all those scenes to [A] this affair
    [E] You're gonna make me [B] lonesome when you [E] go... [E]

        [A] You're gonna make me [A] give myself a [B] good talkin' [B] to

    I'll [E] look for you in old [Emaj7] Honolula, [A] San Francisco, [A] Ashtabula
    [E] You're gonna have to [E] leave me now, I [B] know... [B]
    But I'll [E] see you in the [Emaj7] sky above, in the [A] tall grass, in the [A] ones I love
    [E] You're gonna make me [Emaj7] lonesome when you [E] go... [E]

## Chords used

#### Verse chords

As I note in my video lesson, there's a few caveats of note here. Whenever I play the E-major chord that precedes an E-major-7, I'll only play the highest 4 strings -- which lets the walk-down in the bass note be heard much more prominently. Also, my A-major is technically an Asus2 chord -- play whichever you like. Likewise, I'm doing a modified (easier) B where the highest two strings are left open. You can replace this with a normal B-major, if you like, obviously.

    E ||––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0–––––
    B ||––––0–––––0–––––0–––––0–––––
    G ||––––1–––––1–––––2–––––4–––––
    D ||––––2–––––1–––––2–––––4–––––
    A ||–––(2)––––––––––0–––––2–––––
    E ||–––(0)––––––––––––––––––––––
            E   Emaj7   A     B

#### Refrain chords

I'm playing an Aadd6 for the "A6" chord I note below. You could also make that a F#-minor if you want. I'm playing the A-major and B-major the same way I play them in the verse, but again -- play them like normal if you prefer.

    E ||––––2–––––0–––––2––––––2–––––0–––––0–––––
    B ||––––2–––––0–––––2––––––2–––––0–––––0–––––
    G ||––––2–––––1–––––3––––––3–––––2–––––4–––––
    D ||––––2–––––2–––––4––––––4–––––2–––––4–––––
    A ||––––0–––––2–––––4––––––4–––––0–––––2–––––
    E ||––––––––––0–––––2––––––0–––––––––––––––––
            A6    E     F#    F#/E   A     B


## Basic strumming pattern

The basic pattern I use is as follows. This reads "Down, down... up-down-up" if you were to speak it out loud. I'll show you some ways to add some nuance to this next, but this core pattern by itself I find helpful to start with.

    D = downstrum
    U = upstrum

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D     U D U

## Strumming with bass-note emphasis

#### Strumming pattern basics

For a more advanced strumming pattern, I like to use the following approach -- where each chord's bass note is picked once at the beginning of each strum sequence. The bass down-strum is indicated by the "B" below:

    B = downstrum, bass note only
    D = downstrum, all strings of the chord
    U = upstrum
    > = accented strum

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    B   D     U D U
        >

Which when repeated in sequence looks like this:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    B   D     U D U B   D     U D U B   D     U D U B   D     U D U
        >               >               >               >


#### Simple bass-note emphasis

In practice that look like this:

And so on.

## Advanced bass-note emphasis

Finally, here's a way to use the bass-note emphasis while periodically alternating bass notes on the chords that you stay on for more than one measure. This adds difficulty, but is quite fun to practice & play -- and I think sounds great.
