## Capo 1st fret

I'll teach this song using a capo on the 1st fret. The reason for this is so you can play G-C-D during the chorus sections of this song (which is very satisfying).

## Chorus chords, full strumming

Just play G-C-D. For the D, I prefer the version below but you could just as well play a standard xx0232.

    "Baby, don't you mind if I do..."

    E –––3––––––––––––0––––––––––––          E –––1–––
    B –––0––––––––––––1–––3––––––––          B –––0–––
