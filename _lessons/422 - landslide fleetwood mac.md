## Editor's notes

Hello, my friends! New lesson today for the most requested song in my recent poll... Landslide by Fleetwood Mac. As usual, my lesson will give you everything need to hit the ground running with this song. Chord shapes, progressions, two different ways to approach the fingerstyle, and a bunch of misc tips sprinkled in along the way.

When it comes to fingerpicking technique, I'll show two different options you can use. One is the way I learned it, which is using one right-hand finger per string. But, I'll also show you the Travis picking technique, where your right thumb and index finger are carrying the entire load. No matter your skill level, I'm confident you'll be in good hands with what's in this lesson!

For an extended deep-dive into the chord shapes & fingerstyle techniques needed and how to tackle this song, check out this additional video I made. It looks at both Travis Picking and One-Finger-Per-String fingerstyle, showing you how to play each chord in the song with both of these techniques. This is something I wish I had back when I started playing guitar (and this song especially), so it's my pleasure to pass along this advice to you.
