## Chords w/ lyrics

    VERSE
                          D
        I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
                (C)                           (G)
        I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
                    D
        And I'm not proud of my address
                      (C)                (G)
        In the torn up town, no post code envy

    PRE-CHORUS
                                   D
            But every song's like, gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
            Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
            C                              G
            We don't care... we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

                                  D
            But everybody's like, Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
            Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
            C                         G
            We don't care...we aren't caught up in your love affair

    CHORUS
                                   D
                And we'll never be royals (royals)
                It don't run in our blood
                             C
                That kind of luxe just ain't for us
                           G
                We crave a different kind of buzz

                               D
                Let me be your ruler (ruler)
                You can call me Queen Bee
                               C
                And baby, I'll rule... (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule...)
                G
                ...Let me live that fantasy

        My friends and I, we've cracked the code
        We count our dollars on the train to the party
        And everyone who knows us knows
        That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

            But every song's like, gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
            Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
            We don't care... we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

            But everybody's like, Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
            Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
            We don't care...we aren't caught up in your love affair

                And we'll never be royals (royals)
                It don't run in our blood
                That kind of luxe just ain't for us
                We crave a different kind of buzz

                Let me be your ruler (ruler)
                You can call me Queen Bee
                And baby I'll rule... (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule...)
                Let me live that fantasy

    BRIDGE
                    D                    C  
                    ...Ohhh, ohhh.... oooooo....
                    We're bigger than we ever dreamed
                    G
                    ...And I'm in love with being queen

                    D                    C
                    ...Ohhh, ohhh.... oooooo....
                    Life is great without a care
                              G
                    We aren't caught up in your love affair

                And we'll never be royals (royals)
                It don't run in our blood
                That kind of luxe just ain't for us
                We crave a different kind of buzz

                Let me be your ruler (ruler)
                You can call me Queen Bee
                And baby I'll rule... (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule...)
                Let me live that fantasy

## Notes and tabs

### Guitar Chords Used
This song uses three chords: D, C, and G. They're played in the same exact progression the entire time -- with the exception of the verse, which can alternatively be played using only the D chord. Below, I show a few different ways you might approach playing the D-C-G chords -- these different positions might help you mix it up a bit to add variety. Ultimately, do what works for you -- you can be quite flexible with this song, as the vocals carry the bulk of the weight.

    e-|---2---0---3---   ---2----3----3---   ---10----8-----3---
    B-|---3---1---0---   ---3----3----3---   ---10----8-----3---
    G-|---2---0---0---   ---2----0----0---   ---11----9-----4---
    D-|---0---2---0---   ---0----2----0---   ---12----10----5---
    A-|-------3---2---   --------3----2---   ---12----10----5---
    E-|-----------3---   -------------3---   ---10----8-----3---
          D   C   G         D    C9   G         D     C     G

### Switching Chords During the Verse?
On a guitar, you can get away with playing the verse using only the D chord (as shown here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaknWuU_L4Y). Alternatively, you could employ the D-C-G progression that is used in the rest of the song (as shown here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knacaQWg24A). If you look in the lyrics section above, you'll see I added these C and G chords within the verse inside parentheses -- just so you know where the switches occur. Do what works for you, and have fun with it! There is no "wrong" way to play it, provided that you're making it work for your performance & entertainment needs.
