## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's a new guitar lesson teaching you how to play the rock anthem Don't Look Back in Anger by Oasis, one of my favorite songs from the 1990s. I'll be in standard tuning, Key of C -- showing you the most straightforward way to play this song on an acoustic guitar. This song uses only a handful of chords, and makes heavy use of a walk-down chord progression in both the verse and chorus sections. As always, I'll teach you all the chord shapes needed, talk about strumming, and finish things off with a playthrough of each section. This is one of my favorite songs to sing & strum... I hope you enjoy!

## A quick note about tuning

The Oasis version of this song is played with all instruments tuned sharp (i.e. higher in pitch) -- which means if you are tuned normally, it will sound "off" if you try to play along with them using the chords I show you. This is happening because Oasis is tuned so that A4=451hz, as opposed to "pitch standard" of A4=440hz (which is the way we typically tune our guitars).

If you want to play along with their actual recording, you'll need to retune your guitar using A4=451hz as your reference. [Here's a video](/lessons/359) I made showing how to do this:

Alternatively, you could watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTuGo2XPD6Q) where someone slowed down the Oasis recording so that it's effectively in "pitch standard" of A4=440hz.

All this said, my lesson is in standard tuning (A4=440hz, like a guitar is normally tuned).
