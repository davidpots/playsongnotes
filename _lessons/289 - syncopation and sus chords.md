## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's a quick rhythm technique video, where I talk about sus chords, strumming, and syncopation -- which latter term referring to strumming on the "off" beat. Even if you don't know what these terms mean, I'm certain your ear will immediately hear what I'm talking about. A great many songs use sus chords (e.g., Dsus2, Asus4, etc) -- and they're often played in a way where syncopation is embraced. I wanted to do a quick deep dive into this topic, and visually show via my PDF diagram what exactly is going on with this technique. I hope you enjoy!

## Learn more about syncopation

Here's a podcast episode of [Music Student 101](https://musicstudent101.com/86-syncopation.html) where they talk at length about syncopation, breaking it down into simple terms. The examples they play are especially helpful. I recommend for sure!
