## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here’s my lesson for The Beatles classic “I’ve Just Seen a Face” from their album “Help!” (1965). I’ll teach you a no-capo version of this song (key of G), which keeps all chords easy and allows plenty of opportunity to utilize fun walking bass lines throughout the verse. Whether you want beginner-friendly campfire version, or something more advanced & up-tempo matching what The Beatles play – this tutorial has you covered.

Note, I teach the intro to this song in a separate video lesson (#299) – which should be released by May 6, 2020.

## Lyrics with chords

See PDF for full version (with chords throughout).

    I've just seen a face, I can't forget the time or place
    Where we just met... she's just the girl for me, and I want all
    The world to see we've met... hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm mmm mmm

    Had it been another day, I might have looked the other way
    And I'd have never been aware, but as it is
    I'll dream of her tonight... la, la, la, la la la

        Falling, yes I am falling
        And she keeps calling..... me back again

    I have never known the likes of this, I've been alone
    And I have missed things and kept out of sight, and other girls
    Were never quite like this... da, da, da, da da da

        Falling, yes I am falling
        And she keeps calling..... me back again

    (instrumental verse / solo)

        Falling, yes I am falling
        And she keeps calling..... me back again

    I've just seen a face, I can't forget the time or place
    Where we just met... she's just the girl for me, and I want all
    The world to see her face... hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm mmm mmm

        Falling, yes I am falling
        And she keeps calling..... me back again

        (repeat chorus as desired, end on G)
