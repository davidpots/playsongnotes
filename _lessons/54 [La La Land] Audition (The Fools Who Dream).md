## Lyrics

    Barefoot, she smiled... leapt without looking
    And tumbled into----- the Seine
    The water was freezing, she spent a month sneezing
    But said she would do it  again

        Here's to the ones who dream
        Foolish as they may seem
        Here's to the hearts that ache
        Here's to the mess we make

    She captured a feeling, sky with no ceiling
    The sunset inside a frame
    She lived in her liquor, and died with a flicker
    I'll always remember the flame

        Here's to the ones who dream
        Foolish as they may seem
        Here's to the hearts that ache
        Here's to the mess we make

            She told me...
            A bit of madness is key
            To give us new colors to see
            Who knows where it will lead us?
            And that's why they need us

    So bring on the rebels, the ripples from pebbles
    The painters, and poets, and plays

        And here's to the fools who dream
        Crazy as they may seem
        Here's to the hearts that break
        Here's to the mess we make

                I trace it all back to then
                Her, and the snow, and the Seine
                Smiling through it
                She said she'd do it again

## Stay tuned for more!
