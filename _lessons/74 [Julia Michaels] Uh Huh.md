## Chords needed

Here's how to play the chords used in this song:

    E |–––0––––4–––––4––––5––––7––––7––––
    B |–––0––––5–––––4––––5––––7––––7––––
    G |–––1––––6–––––4––––6––––8––––8––––
    D |–––2––––6–––––6––––7––––9––––7––––
    A |–––2––––4–––––6––––7––––9––––9––––
    E |–––0––––––––––4––––5––––7––––7––––
          E   C#m   G#m   A    B    B7

## Chord progressions

With the exception of the brief pre-chorus, the entire song is played with these four chords in this order:

    E . . . C#m . . . G#m . . . A . . .

For the pre-chorus, you'll simply do two measures of B and then two measures of B7 to build things up:

    B . . . B . . . B7 . . . B7 . . .

## Intro and verse riff

In total, here's the tabs for the main riff you hear in the intro and verse of the song.

If you want to learn this riff and are at all confused, I recommend following these steps so you're adding one thing at a time. Note the timing I include in each tab writeup below... this is helpful to understand which beat each thing is happening on.

### Step 1: rhythm basics

    E |––0–––––––––––––––|–4–––––––––––––––|–4–––––––––––––––|–5–––––––––––––––
    B |––0–––––––––––––––|–5–––––––––––––––|–4–––––––––––––––|–5–––––––––––––––
    G |––1–––––––––––––––|–6–––––––––––––––|–4–––––––––––––––|–6–––––––––––––––
    D |––2–––––––––––––––|–6–––––––––––––––|–6–––––––––––––––|–7–––––––––––––––
    A |––2–––––––––––––––|–4–––––––––––––––|–6–––––––––––––––|–7–––––––––––––––
    E |––0–––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–4–––––––––––––––|–5–––––––––––––––
         E                 C#m               G#m               A
         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +


### Step 2: add arpeggios

    E |––––––––––0–––––––|–––––––––4–––––––|–––––––––4–––––––|–––––––––5–––––––
    B |––––––––––0–––––––|–––––––5–––––––––|–––––––––4–––––––|–––––––––5–––––––
    G |––––––––1–––––––––|–––––6–––––––––––|–––––––4–––––––––|–––––––6–––––––––
    D |––––––2–––––––––––|–––6–––––––––––––|–––––6–––––––––––|–––––7–––––––––––
    A |––––2–––––––––––––|–4–––––––––––––––|–––6–––––––––––––|–––7–––––––––––––
    E |––0–––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–4–––––––––––––––|–5–––––––––––––––
         E                 C#m               G#m               A
         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +


### Step 3: end each chord on a full strum

    E |––––––––––0–––––––|–––––––––4–––––––|–––––––––4–––––––|–––––––––5–––––––
    B |––––––––––0–––––––|–––––––5–5–––––––|–––––––––4–––––––|–––––––––5–––––––
    G |––––––––1–1–––––––|–––––6–––6–––––––|–––––––4–4–––––––|–––––––6–6–––––––
    D |––––––2–––2–––––––|–––6–––––6–––––––|–––––6–––6–––––––|–––––7–––7–––––––
    A |––––2–––––2–––––––|–4–––––––4–––––––|–––6–––––6–––––––|–––7–––––7–––––––
    E |––0–––––––0–––––––|–––––––––––––––––|–4–––––––4–––––––|–5–––––––5–––––––
         E                 C#m               G#m               A
         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +


### Step 4: after each full strum, mute all strings

    E |––––––––––0–x–––––|–––––––––4–x–––––|–––––––––4–x–––––|–––––––––5–x–––––
    B |––––––––––0–x–––––|–––––––5–5–x–––––|–––––––––4–x–––––|–––––––––5–x–––––
    G |––––––––1–1–x–––––|–––––6–––6–x–––––|–––––––4–4–x–––––|–––––––6–6–x–––––
    D |––––––2–––2–x–––––|–––6–––––6–x–––––|–––––6–––6–x–––––|–––––7–––7–x–––––
    A |––––2–––––2–x–––––|–4–––––––4–x–––––|–––6–––––6–x–––––|–––7–––––7–x–––––
    E |––0–––––––0–x–––––|–––––––––––––––––|–4–––––––4–x–––––|–5–––––––5–x–––––
         E                 C#m               G#m               A
         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

### Step 5: add transitional bass notes

    E |––––––––––0–x–––––|–––––––––4–x–––––|–––––––––4–x–––––|–––––––––5–x–––––
    B |––––––––––0–x–––––|–––––––5–5–x–––––|–––––––––4–x–––––|–––––––––5–x–––––
    G |––––––––1–1–x–––––|–––––6–––6–x–––––|–––––––4–4–x–––––|–––––––6–6–x–––––
    D |––––––2–––2–x–––––|–––6–––––6–x–––––|–––––6–––6–x–––––|–––––7–––7–x–––––
    A |––––2–––––2–x–/6––|–4–––––––4–x–––––|–––6–––––6–x–––––|–––7–––––7–x–––––
    E |––0–––––––0–x–––––|–––––––––––––––––|–4–––––––4–x–4–––|–5–––––––5–x–––––
         E                 C#m               G#m               A
         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +

## Lyrics w/ chords

For context, the first verse / pre-chorus / chorus look like this, with the chords displayed alongside:

    VERSE

        E                C#m
        ...It's electric... how my lipstick
        G#m                  A
        ...Makes its own way... right into your kiss, and
        E                C#m
        ...It's pathetic... how we both get
        G#m                 A
        ...Kinda fucked up... hanging on each other
        E                  C#m
        ...We're ahead now... should we slow down?
        G#m                    A
        ...Should we slow down, now?

    PRE-CHORUS
               B                        B7
        'Cause I'm getting some kind of shake without you

    CHORUS
           E                   C#m
    		Uh-huh! I think you're movin' in too close
        G#m                           A
    		But I think that it's my body wanting it the most, like
           E                 C#m
    		Uh-huh! I don't know what it is I feel
            G#m                     A
    		But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like

           E           
    		Uh-huh!... (etc)

And so on.

## Good luck, I hope this helps!
