## Editor's notes

I'd never messed with Open D tuning until this video! Patreon supporter Michael asks about learning a song that isn't in standard tuning, and I show him how I'd go about it.

In the video I'll reference the song Michael sent in -- "Wild Child" by Ghost of Paul Revere -- and give my reaction & advice in real time, as I watch the video. I show my process of figuring out which key the song is in, what chords the song uses, and then wrap my head around open D tuning, which admittedly is 100% new to me. If you want to see what it's like for a relatively experienced guitarist (me) to figure all this out on the fly, with zigs and zags included -- give this a watch!

## The question that inspired this lesson

Patreon supporter Michael asked the following question:

"I am a big fan of the song Wild Child by Ghost of Paul Revere (below) and wanted to learn it but haven't found a tab that looks accurate.  Does it look like he is in different tuning to you?  It does to me since he plays a lot of open in between riffs/chord changes.  Don't need a full tab or lesson (all though it would be nice lol) but if you get a chance could you take a look and see if you can tell what tuning he is in and what the chords are?"

## The song that I'm referencing during the lesson

Here's the song I'm watching during my video. It's called "Wild Child" by Ghost of Paul Revere.
