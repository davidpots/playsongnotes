## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll show you how to play "I've Been Everywhere," as covered by Johnny Cash. This is a fantastically fun song to learn, only requiring 3 chords. I'll teach you the chords, demonstrate a few options with strumming, and show some riffs n' fills you can use to spice things up throughout. I hope you enjoy!
