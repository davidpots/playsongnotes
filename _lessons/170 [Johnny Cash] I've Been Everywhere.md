## Lyrics w/ chords

    INTRO (played freely)

              E                        E
        I was toting my pack along the dusty Winnemucca road
              E                       E
        When along came a semi with a high and canvas covered load
                A7                              A7
        If your going to Winnemucca, Mack, with me you can ride
                 E                               E
        And so I climbed into the cab and then I settled down inside
           B7                              (C7)             (B7)
        He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand
                     E (let ring)                                      (walk up)
        And I said, "Listen... I've traveled every road in this here land"

    CHORUS

            E                            E
            I've been everywhere, man... I've been everywhere, man
            A7                                    E
            Crossed the deserts bare, man... I've breathed the mountain air, man
            B7                                B7             E
            Travel, I've had my share, man... I've been everywhere

## Chords needed

Here's how to play the chords needed in this song. If you prefer, you can substitute a normal "A" chord instead of the "A7" - but I find the A7 captures the bluesy sound of things quite nicely.

    E –––0––––0––––2–––
    B –––0––––2––––0–––
    G –––1––––0––––2–––
    D –––2––––2––––1–––
    A –––2––––0––––2–––
    E –––0–––––––––––––
         E    A7   B7

## Strumming pattern

Simple strum - start by strumming only on the "1" count of each 4-beat measure. This is a great way to start learning the song, especially if you want to play along but want to keep the strumming as simple as possible.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D
    >

Intermediate strum - strum on each of the 4 counts, but put your accents on the "2" and "4" counts. This creates a nice back-beat that is well suited to much of Johnny Cash's musical sound.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D   D
        >       >

Full strum - add a "down up down up" on the back half each each measure. This requires quite a bit of motion (and can become tiring!) but creates a very nice driving sound, if you can manage it.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D U D U
        >       >

## Chord progressions

While this song has distinct verse and chorus sections, they both use the same chords in the same order. There's only one minor difference between the two, which is the chorus stays on "B7" for one measure more than the verse does. For each chord named below, play one measure (4 counts). For each slash ("/"), repeat the previous chord for one measure (4 counts).

Chorus:

    "I've been everywhere, man..."

    E  /  /  /  A7  /  E  /  B7  /  /  E  /

Verse:

    "I've been to Reno, Chicago, Fargo, Minnesota..."

    E  /  /  /  A7  /  E  /  B7  /  E  /

## Riffs and licks

Here are a few fun fills you can insert into the song, as demonstrated in my video lesson. These are nice ways to occasionally mix things up while you're otherwise strumming along. Note, both of these fills begin and end on an E-major chord.

Walk up (heard at the end of the intro):

    E –––0–––|–––––––––––––––0––––        E –––0–––|–––––––––––––––0––––
    B –––0–––|–––––––––––––––0––––        B –––0–––|–––––––––––––––0––––
    G –––1–––|–––––––––––––––1––––        G –––1–––|–––––––––––––––1––––
    D –––2–––|–––––––––1–––––2––––   or   D –––2–––|–––––––––––––––2––––
    A –––2–––|–––2––4––––––––2––––        A –––2–––|–––2––4––6–––––2––––
    E –––0–––|––––––––––––0––0––––        E –––0–––|––––––––––––0––0––––

Walk down (heard at the end of the chorus):

    E –––0–––|––––––––––––––––––0–––
    B –––0–––|––––––––––––––––––0–––
    G –––1–––|––––––––––––––––––1–––
    D –––2–––|––––––––––––––––––2–––
    A –––2–––|–––2––0–––––––––––2–––
    E –––0–––|–––––––––3––2––0––0–––
