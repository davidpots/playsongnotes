## Capo on 3rd fret

Because playing in the key of Eb is rough on guitar, I prefer to capo the 3rd fret so I can use chords in the key of C.

## Chord progressions

Pretty straightforward here... I'm pretty certain _most_ of these are correct (if anything, some of the the E-minor chords may be E-major, and vice versa)... but this should be enough to get you started.

## Instrumental intro riff

Totally optional of course, but I find it fun to play. Repeat this entire sequence twice -- the second time, changing from an A-minor to a C-major (in the 3rd of the 4 total chords).

    VERSE
          Dm                      G
        I think about that day, I left him at a Greyhound station
        C                   A
        West of Santa Fé... we were seventeen
                   Dm                           G
        But he was sweet and it was true, still I did what I
                 C          Am
        Had to do... 'cause I just knew

        Dm                           G
        Summer Sunday nights... we'd sink into our seats, right as they
        C                              A
        Dimmed out all the lights... a Technicolor world made out of
        Dm                      G                       C
        Music and machine... it called me to be on that screen
               Am
        ...And live inside each scene

    PRE-CHORUS
                F                          G
            Without a nickel to my name... Hopped a bus, here I came
            Am                             Em
            Could be brave or just insane... we'll have to see
                   F                                G
            'Cause maybe in that sleepy town, he'll sit one day, the lights are down
                  C                               E
            He'll see my face and think of how he used to know me

    CHORUS
                F                      G                Am
                Climb these hills, I'm reaching for the heights
                    Dm                 G           C
                And chasing all the lights that shine
                    Am                G               Am             G
                And when they let you down...  you'll get up off the ground
                       Am              G                               C         E
                'Cause morning rolls around... and it's another day of--- sun

    [use same chords for each section as shown above]

        I hear 'em every day, the rhythms in the canyons
        That'll never fade away... the ballads in the barrooms
        Left by those who came before... they say "you gotta want it more"
        So I bang on every door

            And even when the answer's "no", or when my money's running low
            The dusty mic and neon glow... are all I need
            And someday as I sing my song, a small-town kid'll come along
            That'll be the thing to push him on and go go

                Climb these hills, I'm reaching for the heights
                And chasing all the lights that shine
                And when they let you down...  you'll get up off the ground
                'Cause morning rolls around... and it's another day of sun
