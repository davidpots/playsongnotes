## Editor's notes

Hey friends! In this lesson I'm excited to teach you how to play "If I Had a Boat" by Lyle Lovett. This one came in by patron request, and it has been my pleasure to learn this song and prepare this lesson. I'll teach you a capo 9 version of this song (how Lovett plays it), focusing on a Travis fingerpicking style matching what he plays. I'll show you the chord shapes, progressions needed, explain the Travis picking basics, and break down the verse/chorus/intro sections with tabs. I hope you enjoy! Send along any other Lyle Lovett requests you may have, as I'd love to know which other songs y'all may want to hear by him.

## Need help learning the chord shapes?

Separate from my full-song sheet music (linked above), I also made this instructional PDF which focuses solely on the chord shapes this song uses during the intro & verse sections. This provides both photos and guitar tabs to help you understand the finger positions necessary -- and the good part is, a lot of your fingers are staying in the same place for all of the chords!
