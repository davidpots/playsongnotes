## Editor's notes

In this video I'll teach you how to play Creep by Radiohead. Specifically, I'll explain how to play this song without requiring barre chords – which can be a deal-breaker for guitarists who are just starting out. I'll explain how a single 3-finger chord voicing can be used to play each chord in this song. I'll also explain the strumming patterns and show some other ways to add flourish. Great song, I hope you enjoy this lesson!

<!-- ## Lyrics w/ chords

    INTRO
    G - B - C - Cm

    VERSE
                         G                                 B
    When you were here before...I couldn’t look you in the eye
                  C                             Cm
    Just like an angel... your skin makes me cry
                     G                         B
    You float like a feather... in a beautiful world
                   C                         Cm
    And I wish was special... you’re so very special

    CHORUS
                  C              B
        But I’m a creep... I’m a weirdo
                                 C                 Cm
        What the hell am I doing here... I don’t belong here

        (repeat same progression for rest of song)

    I don’t care if it hurts... I wanna have control
    I want a perfect body... I want a perfect soul
 I want you to notice... when I’m not around
    You’re so very special... I wish I was special

        But I’m a creep... I’m a weirdo
        What the hell am I doing here?
        When I don’t belong here...

        Whoa, whoa...
        She’s... running out the door...
        She’s... running out, she run, run...
        Run... Run...

    Whatever makes you happy... whatever you want
 You’re so very special... I wish I was special

        But I’m a creep... I’m a weirdo
        What the hell am I doing here?
        I don’t belong here... I don’t belong here

                                        (end on G)

## Chords

I prefer starting with a 3-finger position for each chord:

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––––––––––––––––4–––––
    G –––4––––8––––9––––5–––––
    D –––5––––9–––10––––x–––––
    A –––x––––x––––x––––3–––––
    E –––3––––7––––8––––––––––
         G    B    C    Cm    

As I show in the video lesson, this finger approach lets you add the 4th tone to each chord, to match the vibe that the lead guitarist adds during Radiohead's version of this song. See my video lesson for reference:

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––––––––––––––––6–––––
    G –––5––––9–––10––––5–––––
    D –––5––––9–––10––––x–––––
    A –––x––––x––––x––––3–––––
    E –––3––––7––––8––––––––––
         G4   B4   C4   Cm4    

Or you can play the chords like this:

    4-finger version:                Fully barred version:

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––       E –––3––––7––––8––––3–––––
    B ––––––––––––––––––4–––––       B –––3––––7––––8––––4–––––
    G –––4––––8––––9––––5–––––       G –––4––––8––––9––––5–––––
    D –––5––––9–––10––––5–––––       D –––5––––9–––10––––5–––––
    A –––5––––9–––10––––3–––––       A –––5––––9–––10––––3–––––
    E –––3––––7––––8––––x–––––       E –––3––––7––––8––––x–––––
         G    B    C    Cm                G    B    C    Cm    


## Strumming

Full strum:

    1 e & a 2 e & a 3 e & a 4 e & a 1 e & a 2 e & a 3 e & a 4 e & a
    D       D     U D   D     U D U D     U D U D     U D U D   D U
    >       >           >           >           >           >

Simple strum:

    1 e & a 2 e & a 3 e & a 4 e & a 1 e & a 2 e & a 3 e & a 4 e & a
    D   D   D   D U D   D   D   D U D   D   D   D U D   D   D   D U
    >       >       >       >       >       >       >       >
