## Editor's notes

Hello, friends! New lesson today for SUNDOWN, the folk-country hit from Gordon Lightfoot released back in 1974. Many of you had written in requesting Lightfoot songs over the years - and this is the one that finally sunk its teeth in ([on a recent visit to the Texas gulf coast](https://www.instagram.com/p/CbOIxVuDOye/)).

This song only uses a few chords, but it's the unique voicings Lightfoot using which really steal the show - specifically for the E, E7, and B - none of which use the typical chord shapes we're used to. I'll teach you how Lightfoot plays things, but also show you some fall-backs using common chord shapes if you want something a bit more accessible using what you already know. One other thing I'll teach that Lightfoot doesn't seem to do, is how to play this song using alternating bass notes. This lets you make it a bit more interesting, should you be playing this solo acoustic and want to spice things up.
