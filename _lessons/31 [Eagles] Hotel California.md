## Lyrics with chords

    Bm                          F#
    ...On a dark desert highway... cool wind in my hair
    A                           E
    ...Warm smell of colitas...... rising up through the air
    G                           D
    ...Up ahead in the distance... I saw a shimmering light
    Em                                         F#
    ...My head grew heavy & my sight grew dim... I had to stop for the night

    Bm                                F#
    ...There she stood in the doorway... I heard the mission bell
    A                                           E
    ...I was thinking to myself, "This could be heaven or this could be hell"
    G                            D
    ...Then she lit up a candle... and she showed me the way
    Em                                     F#
    ...There were voices down the corridor... I thought I heard them say...

            G                           D
            ...Welcome to the Hotel California
                   F#                   Bm      (walk up)
            Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
            G                               D
            Plenty of room at the Hotel California
                Em                    F#
            Any time of year, you can find it here

    Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
    She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
    How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
    Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

    So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"
    He said, "we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine"
    And still those voices are calling from far away
    Wake you up in the middle of the night, just to hear them say

            Welcome to the Hotel California
            Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
            They living it up at the Hotel California
            What a nice surprise, bring your alibis

    Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
    And she said, "we are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
    And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
    They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast

    Last thing I remember, I was... running for the door
    I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
    "Relax" said the night man, "we are programmed to receive.
    You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave!"
