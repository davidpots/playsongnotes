## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Quick lesson today teaching you how to play an easy-going acoustic version of The Middle by Jimmy Eat World (2001). Originally a pop-punk song with a driving beat, this acoustic arrangement is inspired by musician Kina Grannis, who is known for creating lo-fi, folky acoustic covers of popular rock songs. This song is only 3 chords, with the same chord progression repeating throughout -- so it doesn't take long to learn! But I'll look a bit beneath the surface and show you ways to have fun with the chord voicings, and also how to strum while playing the melody notes for the verse and chorus. Let's check it out!
