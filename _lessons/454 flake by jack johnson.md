In this week's lesson I'll teach you to play **Flake** by Jack Johnson, from his 2001 debut album. I'll begin by teaching things exactly as Johnson plays them, including the barre chords (showing a few helpful tips to simplify them) and also the strumming pattern — which I'll walk through step-by-step. At the end of the lesson I'll show a preview of my easy-going fingerstyle arrangement, should you want an easier way to perform this great song. Enjoy!

## Part 2 - Fingerstyle Version

Here's my deep-dive into the fingerstyle version I preview at the end of my free lesson. I'll show how you can play this song using chord shapes in the Key of C, which avoids barre chords altogether. Similarly, I'll be using an easy-going fingerpicking pattern which still manages to capture Johnson's percussive vibe.
