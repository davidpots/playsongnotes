## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll show you how to play "A Million Dreams" from the soundtrack of The Greatest Showman - complete with chords, intro tabs, and strumming pattern help! Note, my video lesson above doesn't tackle the bridge -- but that section is indeed included my 3-page sheet music linked above.

Lesson timestamps:

- 0:58 Intro fingerpicking w/ tabs
- 8:38 Verse/chorus chords & strumming

## My play-along cover

Here's a video of me playing the intro, verse, pre-chorus, and chorus.
