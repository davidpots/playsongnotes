## Intro tab

Here's the full tab:

    A ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3–––––3–––––3–––––3–––––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
        G                       D/F#                    Em                      C
        1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
        G                       D/F#                    C                       C
        1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +

If you're just learning this, first understand these key chord shapes (and add the fingerpicking only after you have these down pat):

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    G ––4–––––––––––––––––––––––2–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––0–––––––––––––––––––––––
    D ––5–––––––––––––––––––––––4–––––––––––––––––––––––2–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    A ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3–––––––––––––––––––––––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
        G                       D/F#                    Em                      C
        1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +

## Intro tab chord finger positions

This is how I recommend placing your left hand fingers when playing these chords. This will ensure the transitions are as easy as possible.

    E ––––––
    B ––––––
    G ––4–––  <-- left middle
    D ––5–––  <-- left ring
    A ––––––
    E ––––––
        G    

    E ––––––
    B ––––––
    G ––2–––  <-- left index
    D ––4–––  <-- left ring
    A ––––––
    E ––––––
       D/F#    

    E ––––––
    B ––3–––  <-- left pinky
    G ––––––  
    D ––2–––  <-- left middle
    A ––––––
    E ––––––
        Em

    E ––––––
    B –(1)––  <-- left index
    G ––0–––  <-- open (no left finger)
    D ––––––  
    A ––3–––  <-- left ring
    E ––––––
        C

## Strumming

Simplest strumming pattern is down strums on the 2 and 4 beats (make sure these get the accent).

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
        D       D       D       D
        >       >       >       >

If you want to strum a bit more, do a "Down, down up... up down up..." that repeats. Likewise, accent the 2 and the 4 count.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D U   U D U D   D U   U D U
        >       >       >       >-

## Lyrics w/ chords

Note that "D" and "D/F#" are interchangeable... the latter is an optional voicing where you have F# as the bass note, the emphasize the descending bass line. If you don't already know (or want) to play D/F#, then just replace it below with a D wherever you see it.

    VERSE
    G                D/F#             Em                     C             G
    ...I close my eyes... and I can see... the world that's waiting up for me
    G            D/F#    C
    ......That I call my own
    G              D/F#                Em                    C               G
    ...Through the dark... through the door... through where no one's been before
    G            D/F#       C
    ......But it feels like home


    PRE-CHORUS
    D                         Em                  C
    ...They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
    D                         Em               C
    ...They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
    D                        Em                 C
    ...I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy
    D                   Em              C
    ...We can live in a world that we design


    CHORUS
           G                               D/F#
    'Cause every night I lie in bed... the brightest colors fill my head
      Am                             C
    A million dreams are keeping me awake
      G                                     D/F#
    I think of what the world could be... a vision of the one I see
      Am                               C
    A million dreams is all it's gonna take
      C (let ring)
    A million dreams for the world we're gonna make

Repeat the progressions above for the additional verse and pre-chorus and chorus sections. Thanks and good luck!
