## Editor's notes

Hello, my friends! Happy to share a new guitar lesson teaching you how to play The Christmas Waltz. While originally recorded by Frank Sinatra (1954), it's the She & Him version (2011) that I'll be basing my lesson off of. This lets you play this classic holiday song with a single acoustic guitar, fairly easy chord chord shapes, and spares you of any overly complex or tricky transitions. I'll explain the three-quarter time waltz feel, teach the chord shapes & progressions needed, and finally do a full playthrough of the entire song. This has been one of my all-time favorite Christmas songs, and it's a pleasure to share this lesson with you. Enjoy!
