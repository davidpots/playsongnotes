## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Quick question & answer video here, where Tim writes in asking about playing without a pick: he says his thumb is doing him just fine -- and he's wondered if he is missing out on anything. In this video I'll give my thoughts (if it works for you, keep it up!) -- and show off 3 basic techniques for strumming without using a pick, should you find yourself curious. To be honest, the last 1-2 years I've found myself more and more comfortable strumming without a pick -- so I'm quite happy to show you some of my favorite approaches.

Here's the timestamps so you know what you're in for.

- 0:44 Brushing with your thumb
- 1:52 Strumming with your index finger
- 3:42 Strumming with thumb & index finger	 
- 5:53 Farewell & send in your questions!

Enjoy! And send in any questions you have to play.songnotes@gmail.com
