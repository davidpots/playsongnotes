## Editor's notes

In this lesson, I'll teach you how to play "Learnin' to Fly" by Tom Petty – complete with chords, tabs, strumming pattern, and rhythm tips. This entire song only uses 4 chords, in the same order, the entire time – so it's quite easy to get started with! And if you want to take it a step further, there's good opportunity to add some flourish notes to spice things up. Here's what's in the video:

## Chords needed

The entire song uses these 4 chords, in this order, repeating. The pinky on the high E-string (for all chords) isn't required for the C and Am, but it helps keep the sound consistent. Play whatever version of F you prefer – I like this one (or a 3-string version on the D/G/B strings) because they work well with the flourish-note riff I show below.

    E –––3–––        ––––3–––           –––3–––              –––3–––
    B –––1–––        ––––1–––           –––1–––              –––0–––
    G –––2–––        ––––0–––           –––2–––              –––0–––
    D –––3–––        ––––2–––           –––2–––              –––0–––
    A –––––––        ––––3–––           –––0–––              –––2–––
    E –––––––        ––––––––           –––––––              –––3–––
         F               C                 Am                   G   

## Strumming and timing

An easy way to play this is using all down-strums. As such, divide up each chord as follows – and accent the first strum of each chord.

    F        C              Am       G
    •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  
    >        >              >        >

The same diagram but with counting instead of generic dots (for each eighth note), is as follows:

    F        C              Am       G
    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
    >        >              >        >

## Adding flourish note to your strumming

While doing your regular strumming, try to add/remove the notes shown below. See my video for reference.

    E ––––3––––––––3––––––––––––––3––––––––3–––––––––––––––
    B ––––1––––––––1––––––––––––––1––0––1––0–––––1––0––––––
    G ––––2––0––2––0––––––––––––––2––––––––0–––––––––––––––
    D ––––3––––––––2––––––––––––––2––––––––0–––––––––––––––
    A –––––––––––––3––––––––––––––0––––––––2–––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––3–––––––––––––––
          1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
          F        C              Am       G

          F          C      Am   G        F     C       Am   G
        I guess I'll know........... when I get there

                F           C    Am  G     F        C      Am  G
            I'm learning to fly......... around the clouds
                F         C    Am  G     F         C     Am   G
            But what goes up............ must come down
                F           C    Am  G       F           C      Am  G
            I'm learning to fly......... but I ain't got wings
            F      C       Am   G               F       C       Am   G
