## Editor's Notes

Hey there friends! Excited to share my first ever "radio" show of sorts, where I use Patreon's handy audio feature to share some of my favorite music -- with just a bit of context & commentary sprinkled in by me, letting you know why I think these songs are special. In this first episode, I'll be diving into 4 new songs from this past month that I think you may dig. Just over 20 minutes. Give it a listen if you're looking for some new tunes... and let me know what you think!

Listen here:
