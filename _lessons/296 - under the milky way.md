## Lyrics with chords

    INTRO

        | Am . . . | Am7 . . . | Fmaj7 . . . | G . . . | (x2)

    VERSE

        Am                   Am7                Fmaj7   G
        ...Sometimes on this place gets kind of empty
        Am              Am7                   Fmaj7   G
        ...Sound of the breath fades with the light
        Am          Am7          Fmaj7         G
        ...I think about... the loveless fascination
        Am           Am7          Fmaj7   G
        ...Under the Milky Way tonight

        [Am] Lower the [Am7] curtain down in [Fmaj7] Memphis [Em]
        [Am] Lower the [Am7] curtain down, alright [Fmaj7] [Em]
        [Am] I got no [Am7] time... for [Fmaj7] private consultation [Em]
        [Am] Under the [Am7] Milky Way [Fmaj7] tonight [Em]

    CHORUS
            G                            Fmaj7

            G                                  Fmaj7
            ...Might have known what you would find

        [Am] And its [Am7] something quite peculiar [Fmaj7] [Em]
        [Am] Something [Am7] shimmering and [Fmaj7] white [Em]
        [Am] It leaves you [Am7] here... [Fmaj7] despite your destination [Em]
        [Am] Under the [Am7] Milky Way [Fmaj7] tonight [Em]

            [G] Wish I knew what you were [Fmaj7] looking for
            [G] Might have known what you would [Fmaj7] find

            [G] Might have known what you would [Fmaj7] find

                | C . . . | G . . . | Am . . . | Am . . . | (x4)

        [Am] And its [Am7] something quite peculiar [Fmaj7] [Em]
        [Am] Something [Am7] shimmering and [Fmaj7] white [Em]
        [Am] It leaves you [Am7] here... [Fmaj7] despite your destination [Em]
        [Am] Under the [Am7] Milky Way [Fmaj7] tonight [Em]

## Chord shapes used

Here's the chord shapes you'll need if you're playing without a capo (which is what I do in my video lesson). As I note below, I'll use the Am7 and A-minor sus4 interchangeably in this song. The sus4 variant is technically what the non-capo'd guitarist is playing, but I find the Am7 to capture the sound that the capo-5 guitarist is playing -- which you can hear on the album. Again, the choice is yours as to which of these two chords you use. During the verse I sometimes use the sus4 variant, while in the intro I like the Am7. Also, for the Fmaj7 note it sounds fine if you include the open 5th string (A) -- I consider this optional.

    e –––0–––  ––3–––––––––  –––0––––3––––3––––0–––
    B –––1–––  ––1–––––3–––  –––1––––0––––0––––1–––
    G –––2–––  ––2–––––2–––  –––2––––0––––0––––0–––
    D –––2–––  ––2–––––2–––  –––3––––0––––2––––2–––
    A –––0–––  ––0–––––0–––  ––(0)–––2––––2––––3–––
    E –––––––  ––––––––––––  ––––––––3––––0––––––––
         Am     Am7 Amsus4    Fmaj7  G    Em   C

### About the A-minor 7 vs. A-minor sus4 chord

Heads up, where I show an Am7 in the verse you can instead play an A-minor sus4. I'm sure many would say the sus4 is the "correct" way to play the A-minor, as even the guitarist states that's how he plays it in interviews, etc. But...

In reality, there's also a guitar with capo 5th fret in the recording of this song (playing the chords of Em-Em7-Cmaj7-D). And on that Em7 chord, the 3rd fret of the B string can clearly be heard on the recording -- and in my opinion, is vital to the sound of the intro strumming especially. Accordingly, I prefer the Am7 because that 3rd fret of the high-E string captures the sound that this would-be second guitar plays. Ultimately, it's up to you whether you use Am7 or Am-sus4. I even tend to favor the sus4 variant during the verses. Just calling this out so you're informed and can make the decision that works best for you.

### About the F# bass note...

Also, while I don't show it in the lesson -- there is an F# note (2nd fret of low E string) that's played as the bass note of the Am7 (or Amsus4) in the second verse onward -- i.e., when the bass kicks in. This is a non-conventional bass note to be played under an A-minor chord, which adds quite a bit of distinction to the sound of this song. I find this very difficult and non-practical to play in a solo acoustic rendition. But, if you want to attempt it -- wrap your left thumb around the neck of the guitar to add a bass note to to that chord.

## Strumming pattern

The main pattern used throughout this song is as follows. Note it is a 2-measure pattern (i.e., requiring 8 beats to play the full sequence, then it is repeated). This is the pattern I use in the "Chord Progression" section later in this document.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D U D U   U D   D U D U

If you want something simpler, just use this more straightforward pattern.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D U D U

## Chord progression cheat sheet

Intro & verse:

    | Am    | Am7   | Fmaj7   | G      |
    
Verse, after bass kicks in (2nd verse onward):

    | Am    | Am7   | Fmaj7   | Em     |
    
Chorus:

    | G     | G     | Fmaj7   | Fmaj7  |

Refrain:

    | C     | G     | Am      | Am     |

## Chord progression with strumming

Here's the chord progression mapped against the strumming, which lyrics for reference. Note how the chord 2nd and 4th chord changes happen on the "up" strum just before the "1" count. This can tricky to master at first.

### Intro & first verse

    "Sometimes... place...            empty..."
    Am            Am7                 Fmaj7         G
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D U D U   U D   D U D U   D   D   D U D U   U D   D U D U
    
### Second verse onward

The Am7 has a F# bass note (2nd fret of low E string). By no means required, but including it here in case you're interested. You can play this by wrapping your left thumb on the 2nd fret of the low E string -- which is tricky, and honestly I don't bother.

    "Lower the    curtain down in     Memphis..."
    Am            Am7*                Fmaj7         Em
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D U D U   U D   D U D U   D   D   D U D U   U D   D U D U

### Chorus

    "Wish I knew what you were        looking for..."
    G                                 Fmaj7
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D U D U   U D   D U D U   D   D   D U D U   U D   D U D U

### Refrain

    C             G                   Am
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D U D U   U D   D U D U   D   D   D U D U   U D   D U D U
