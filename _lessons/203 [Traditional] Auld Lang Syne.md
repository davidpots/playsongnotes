## Editor's notes

With New Years just around the corner, I wanted to learn this very timely traditional song - Auld Lang Syne. This video shows a relatively simple way to play it, involving strummable chords with a melody that weaves through each of the 8 measures. I'll teach the chords, explain the melody, talk about some of the difficult transitions - all with tabs to help you through it. I hope you enjoy! Happy New Years to you and yours - here's to many more years of music for all of us.

## Guitar arrangement

Here's the arrangement I'm using in my video lesson. This is 8 bars, which can be repeated over and over again if you want to play additional verses and/or choruses. Your job is to either strum, pluck, or fingerpick the chords - adding melody notes as you desire. For your ending, the final measure should be the C chord only (without the G). If you are repeating the 8 bars, the final measure should include the G chord on the final 2 counts - which creates a nice "turn around" to setup the C in the first bar.

## Chord guidance

For a few of these chords, I want to call out some tips that will help you on your way - specifically with finger positions.

### G major chord

For the G major chord, notice how you're not really ever putting a left-finger on the 1st string (high E string). Also, you'll often need to remove the 2nd-string-3rd-fret note, in order to play the 2nd-string-1st-fret. As such, you'll want to use your pinky on the 3rd fret of the 2nd (B) string. This sets up your index finger to be in place at the same time.

    E –––––                               E –––––
    B ––3–– <= left pinky                 B ––1–– <= left index
    G ––0––                               G ––0––
    D ––0––                               D ––0––
    A ––2–– <= left middle                A ––2–– <= left middle
    E ––3–– <= left ring                  E ––3–– <= left ring
        G                                     G*

### F7 and F#dim7 chord

For the F7 and the F#dim7, the main thing to call out is that the thinnest 3 strings will use the exact same notes (and fingers). All that changes between these two chords is which fret your left index finger is playing.

    E ––5–– <= left pinky                 E ––5–– <= left pinky
    B ––4–– <= left middle                B ––4–– <= left middle
    G ––5–– <= left ring                  G ––5–– <= left ring  
    D ––3–– <= left index                 D ––4–– <= left index
    A –––––                               A –––––
    E –––––                               E –––––
        F7                                  F#dim7

If the F7 section gives you trouble, use this voicing. I got this via Justin Sandercoe's lesson. You can ignore the F#dim7 chord altogether.

    E ––5–– <= left pinky
    B ––x–– <= (muted by left ring)
    G ––5–– <= left ring  
    D ––3–– <= left index
    A –––––               
    E –––––               
        F7     

### Switching from the C to F7

The most difficult part of this song, for me, is switching from the C to the F7. Here's one important tip when practicing this - which is your right pinky is staying on the high-E string for both chords! Specifically, it's moving up from the 3rd fret to the 5th fret (of the high E-string). This is a helpful thing to keep in mind, as it is one less finger that needs to switch strings. Here's a simple deconstruction of this progression to practice - do it slow over and over again, until you can do it without mistakes. From there, slowly speed it up until you can play it at the pace of the normal song.

    E –––3–––5–––   <= left pinky stays on this string for both chords!
    B –––1–––4–––
    G –––0–––5–––
    D –––2–––3–––
    A –––3–––––––
    E –––––––––––
         C   F7  

### F major chord

Don't let the F chord in the 7th measure throw you off. You don't need to do any barring! Here's two ways to play it. The first way (left) shows you a 4-string version, where you're only playing the thickest four strings. However, if this voicing is too difficult - try the right version - which ignores the 6th (lowest) string. This lets you only worry about 3 strings, which is much easier to switch to in a hurry. In a pinch, I'll use this version so I can be sure I stay in time (especially when playing with people singing).

    E –––––                               E –––––
    B –––––                               B –––––
    G ––2–– <= left middle                G ––2–– <= left middle
    D ––3–– <= left pinky                 D ––3–– <= left pinky
    A ––3–– <= left ring                  A ––3–– <= left ring  
    E ––1–– <= left index                 E –––––       
        F                                     F*    


## Lyrics

Here's the English translation of the lyrics, in the "minimalist" translation [as per Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne):

    Should old acquaintance be forgot,
    and never brought to mind?
    Should old acquaintance be forgot,
    and old lang syne?

        CHORUS:
        For auld lang syne, my dear,
        for auld lang syne,
        we'll take a cup of kindness yet,
        for auld lang syne.

    And surely you'll buy your pint cup!
    and surely I'll buy mine!
    And we'll take a cup o' kindness yet,
    for auld lang syne.

        [CHORUS]

    We two have run about the slopes,
    and picked the daisies fine;
    But we've wandered many a weary foot,
    since auld lang syne.

        [CHORUS]

    We two have paddled in the stream,
    from morning sun till dine†;
    But seas between us broad have roared
    since auld lang syne.

        [CHORUS]

    And there's a hand my trusty friend!
    And give me a hand o' thine!
    And we'll take a right good-will draught,
    for auld lang syne.

        [CHORUS]

## Good luck!
