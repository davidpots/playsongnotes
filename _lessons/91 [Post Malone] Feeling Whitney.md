## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll show you how to play "Feeling Whitney" by Post Malone. This song uses only a handful of conventional chords, but the fingerpicking pattern has been the fun part about learning it for me. I'll show you tabs for fingerpicking each of the chords needed, and explain how to practice it all & put it all together. I hope you enjoy!

## Chords needed

First off, you'll want to know these basic chord positions for this song. Even though you'll be fingerpicking (instead of strumming), I strongly advise you get used to putting your left hand into these full chord positions -- even for fingerpicking.

    E –––0––––0––––1––––3––––
    B –––1––––1––––1––––0––––
    G –––0––––2––––2––––0––––
    D –––2––––2––––3––––0––––
    A –––3––––0––––3––––2––––
    E –––––––––––––1––––3––––
         C    Am   F    G   

There's also these slight modifications of the chords above, which are used in a few places.

    E –––0–––––1–––––
    B –––1–––––0–––––
    G –––3–––––0–––––
    D –––2–––––0–––––
    A –––3–––––2–––––
    E –––––––––3–––––
         C7    G7

## Fingerpicking patterns

Once you know the chords, it's time to learn the basic fingerpicking patterns. The good news: there is a ton of consistency here. For the C, Am, F, and C7 you have the same general pattern -- lowest note, highest note, 2nd lowest note, 2nd highest note. While the strings played per each chord are different, it's not terribly difficult to memorize. Print this out (or write it down) if you are having trouble memorizing things... the hard part will be getting your right hand's fingers to play along with the instructions your brain will be giving them.

Each pattern below needs to be repeated (usually 8 times).

    E –––––––––––––––––  
    B –––––1–––––––––––   <-- right ring
    G ––––––––––––0––––   <-- right middle
    D ––––––––2––––––––   <-- right index                 
    A –––3–––––––––––––   <-- right thumb

    A –––0–––––––––––––   <-- right thumb                
    E –––––––––––––––––

    D –––––––––––––––––                   
    A –––––––––––––––––                   
    E –––3–––––––––––––   <-- right thumb

## Lyrics w/ chords

    VERSE

        C
        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
        Am
        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
        F                                 C
        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

            C
        And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
        Am
        I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
            F
        And I ain't seen a light of day since, well, that's not important
                  C
        It's been---- long

            C
        And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip Houston
        Am
        Cars and clothes, thought I was winning, you knew I was losing
            F
        You told me to wake up, oh, my clock always stays on snooze, and
            C       C7
        I'm done

    CHORUS

           F
        To each their own and, find peace in knowing
              C
        Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
             F
        Show no emotion, against your coding
             C                  G
        Just act as hard as you can
                                G7  (stop)
        You don't need a friend........... boy, you're the man

    (repeat these progressions for remaining verse & choruses)

## Good luck!
