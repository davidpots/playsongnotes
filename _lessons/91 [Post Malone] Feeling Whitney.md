## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll show you how to play "Feeling Whitney" by Post Malone. This song uses only a handful of chords, but the fingerpicking pattern has been the fun part about learning it for me. I'll show you tabs for fingerpicking each of the chords needed, and explain how to practice it all & put it all together. I hope you enjoy!
