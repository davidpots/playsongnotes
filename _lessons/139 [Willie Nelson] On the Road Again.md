## Capo 4th fret to play with Willie

On this page, I'm teaching this song using chords in the key of C (which are easier to play than the key of E, which is what Willie uses). Add a capo on the 4th fret, using chords in C, to play with Willie. Otherwise, a capo isn't needed.

## Lyrics with chords

    VERSE
               C                                           E
        On the road again... just can't wait to get on the road again
                                  Dm
        The life I love is making music with my friends
            F                   G           C
        And I can't wait to get on the road again

               C                                    E
        On the road again... going places that I've never been
                                 Dm
        Seeing things that I may never see again
            F                   G            C
        And I can't wait to get on the road again

    CHORUS

               F                                               C
        On the road again... like a band of gypsies we go down highway
                  F                                                        C
        We're the best of friends... insisting that the world keep turning our way
            G        (silence chord)
        And our way...

    SOLO

        (use verse chords)

    CHORUS

        (repeat same chorus above)

    VERSE
                     C                                        E
        ...is on the road again just can't wait to get on the road again
                                  Dm
        The life I love is making music with my friends
            F                   G           C
        And I can't wait to get on the road again

## How to play the chords

Here's the easiest way to play the chords. Of course, I'm showing a simplified F below (use a full F if you're able to play it). You can also use an E7 and G7 if you wish - but these aren't required.

    E –––0–––1–––0–––––––3–––
    B –––1–––3–––0–––1–––0–––
    G –––0–––2–––1–––2–––0–––
    D –––2–––0–––2–––3–––0–––
    A –––3–––––––2–––3–––2–––
    E –––––––––––0–––––––3–––
         C   Dm  E   F   G

## Strumming pattern

To keep things simple, I recommend all downstrums (4 per measure) with accents on the 2 and 4 counts. See my video lesson for some context here.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D   D
        >       >

From there, you could add some upstrums within this pattern – specifically in the final half.

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
    D   D   D U D U
        >       >
