## Video lesson

Here's my lesson, including a play-through with chords and tabs overlaid. Please refer to this when using everything further down this page -- everything I play here, I explain below.

## Use a capo!

Unless you want to play it in E-flat, which I don't, then add a capo on the 3rd fret. Then you use chords in the family of C (much easier) and be able to play along with the soundtrack, or my lesson.

## Chords used

Here's how to play'em!

## Tab for the instrumental break

First, I'll play this more subdued version. That is, I only play 2-3 strings at a time and keep things kinda chill. This is a good way to start if you want to build things up.

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –––(1)–––––––––0––1––––|–––(3)––––––––––––3––––
    G ––––2––2––2––––2––2––––|––––4––4––4––––5––4––––
    D ––––3––3––3––––3––3––––|––––5––5––5––––5––5––––
    A –––––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––
          F                       G

    E ––––0––0––0––––3––0––––|–––––––––––––––0–––––––
    B ––––1––1––1––––1––1––––|––––1––1––1––––1––1––––
    G ––––0––0––0––––0––0––––|––––2––2––2––––2––2––––
    D ––––2––––––––––––––––––|––––2––2––2––––2––2––––
    A ––––3––––––––––––––––––|––––0––––––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––
          C                       Am

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –––(1)–––––––––0––1––––|–––(3)––––––––––––3––––
    G ––––2––2––2––––2––2––––|––––4––4––4––––5––4––––
    D ––––3––3––3––––3––3––––|––––5––5––5––––5––5––––
    A –––––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––
          F                       G

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––1––1––1––––1––1––––|––––1––1––1––––1––1––––
    G ––––2––2––2––––2––2––––|––––2––2––2––––2––2––––
    D ––––2––2––2––––2––2––––|––––2––2––2––––2––2––––
    A ––––0––––––––––––––––––|––––0––––––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––
             Am                                Am

Then, I'll repeat what I did above but won't hold back with the intensity (i.e., I'll actually build it up to a peak). Note how for the F and G I'll play the lower bass notes. This is harder to do and not required.

## Lyrics w/ chords

Please note, this skimps over the longer instrumental part you hear in the soundtrack version. Below, I'm matching to what I play in my video lesson's play-through. Apologies for it being somewhat limited, but I hope it gets you off the ground and running with things.

    INTRO

        C                           F/C     C
        ...You got the invitation...   you got the right address
        C                                    F/C      C
        ...You need some medication...   the answer's always yes
        Dm                            Em       Dm                   C
        ...A little chance encounter could be the one you've waited for
                 C
        Just squeeze a bit more

        C                     F/C      C
        ...Tonight we're on a mission... tonight's the casting call
        C                        F/C     C  
        ...If this is the real audition... oh, God, help us all
        Dm                      Em       Dm                              
        ...You make the right impression... then everybody knows your
        C
        Name... we're in the fast lane

    CHORUS

        F              G                  C               A7
        Someone in the crowd could be the one you need to know
            F              G                C          A7
        The one to finally lift you off the ground
        F              G                    C                 A7
        Someone in the crowd could take you where you want to go
            F                 G           Am
        If you're the someone ready to be found

    REFRAIN

                    Am                       F
        Do what you need to do, til' they discover you
                      G                            C     E
        And make them more than you, you're seeing now
                    Am                        F
        So make the stars align, I think I'll stay behind
                      G
        You've got to go and find... (that someone in the crowd)

    (Instrumental break, not covered here)

    CHORUS, slow

           F              G              C                A7
        Is someone in the crowd the only thing you really see?
        F                  G                     C        A7
        Watching while the world keeps spinning 'round
        F                   G                  C             A7
        Somewhere there's a place where I find who I'm gonna be
          F                     G             Am
        A somewhere that's just waiting to be found

    INSTRUMENTAL BUILD UP (shortened)

        F  G  C  Am
        F  G  Am Am
        F  G  C  Am
        Bm E  A

    CHORUS, finale

        F              G                 C               A7
        Someone in the crowd will be the one you need to know
        F               G                C               A7
        Someone who can lift you off the ground
        F              G                   C                 A7    
        Someone in the crowd will take you where you want to go
        F              G
        Someone in the crowd will make you
        F              G                    Em             A7
        Someone in the crowd will take you, flying off the ground
            F                  G                    C                                      
        If you're that someone ready... to... be... found

## Thanks!

I hope this helped. If there's anything specific I didn't cover that you'd like to see, please let me know!
