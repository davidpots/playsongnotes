## Lyrics w/ chords

    (capo 7 fret)

    INTRO

        C ... Am7 ... Em ... G ...
        C ... Am7 ... Em ... F ...

    VERSE

        C                    Am7               Em       Em
        I was just coasting, never really goin anywhere
        C                        Am7                  Em           Em
        Caught up in a web I was gettin kinda used to staying there
            C     Am7        Em    Em
        And out------ of the blue
        C       Am7            Em    G (let ring)
        I------------ fell for you

            (no chord)            C                         Am7
            Now you're lifting me up, instead of holding me down
                        Em                           G
            Stealing my heart instead of stealing my crown
              C                                 Am7               Em    F
            Untangled all the strings around my wings that were tied

                          C                     Am7
            I didn't know him and I didn't know me
                  Em                     G
            Cloud nine was always out of reach
            C                      Am7           Em    G
            Now I remember what it feels like to fly

                               C    Am7   Em   F
            You give me butterflies

        C                  Am7                          Em          Em
        Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
              C                        Am7                  Em         Em
        I was hiding in doubt till you brought me out of my chrysalis
            C      Am7            Em    Em
        And I----------- came out new
        C      Am7                  Em    G
        All------------- because of you

            Now you're lifting me up instead of holding me down
            Stealing my heart instead of stealing my crown
            Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied

            I didn't know him and I didn't know me
            Cloud nine was always out of reach
            Now I remember what it feels like to fly

                               C    Am7   Em   G
            You give me butterflies
                                     C    Am7   Em  F
            Yeah, you give me butterflies

        BRIDGE

                Dm ... Dm ... Am7 ... G  ...
                Dm ... Dm ... F   ... Fm ...

            [ repeat chorus, w/ fingerpicking for first few lines ]

        ENDING

                C    Am7   Em   G     x2, then end on C
