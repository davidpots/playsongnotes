## Editor's notes

Hey there, friends! Brand new lesson today teaching you how to play MILLIONAIRE, as covered by Chris Stapleton on his 2017 album From A Room: Volume 2. This is one so many of you requested over the past year, including Patreon supporter Thomas -- who let me know this song was originally written & recorded by Kevin Welch (2002).

In this lesson I'll give you the usual: a look at the chords needed, the verse & chorus progressions, strumming patterns, and above all -- that intro riff! I'll break the riff down in 3 different ways, with the hope that one (if not multiple) of the approaches will take you where you want to go.
