## Editor's notes

In my first lesson, I show you how to play the basics of "Mrs. Robinson" by Simon and Garfunkel. I'll be using no capo and will focus primarily on the chords and strumming patterns you'll need to play the song. This lesson includes chord charts, tablature, strumming pattern diagrams, and the progressions you'll need for each section. If you're looking for some of the more advanced riffs, runs, and fills this song uses -- look for my other lesson where I break those down in detail.

In my second lesson, I'll show you how to play some of the fills, riffs, and runs for this song. This is a slightly more intermediate lesson, following up on my beginner-friendly lesson that shows the basic chords and strumming patterns needed to play this song. In this lesson, I'll be playing without a capo –– and will show you how to play the (1) intro/filler riff; (2) a verse melody riff; (3) the verse walkdown from C to A minor; and (4) the chorus walkdown from C to D to G.

Timestamps for my second lesson:

- 0:00 Lesson overview
- 3:05 Intro & Filler Riff
- 7:06 Verse Melody Riff
- 9:13 Verse Walkdown (C to Am)
- 11:04 Chorus Walkdown (C to D to G)

## Chord progressions

    See my sheet music for the chord progression diagram.

<!-- Intro & filler riff:

    E   /   /   /     ...played w/ bass-line riff

Verse:

    "We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files..."

    E   /   /   E7   /   A   /   A7  /
    D   G   C   Am   /   E   /   D7  /  

Chorus:

    "And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson..."

    G   Em  G   Em   C   /   D   /
    G   Em  G   Em   C   /   Am  /    intro w/ riff -->

## Strumming pattern

There's some flexibility with how you strum, though I think the most important thing is to accent the 2nd (and possibly 4th) beat of every four-beat measure. You might start with practicing down-strums only, on the 2nd and 4th beats:

    See my sheet music for the strumming diagram.

<!-- ↓               ↓      
1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +   -->

Once you have that, you can add to it by adding some additional strums (played not quite as loud) on these other beats. Again, make sure the 2nd and 4th beats are where most of your accent is.

    See my sheet music for the strumming diagram.

<!-- >               >      
↓       ↓   ↑       ↑   ↓   ↑  
1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +    -->



## Intro and fill riff

Repeat this as desired (usually two or four times is what I do). If you prefer, you can strum the E-chord for the full duration of this 8-count section, while accenting the bass-line melody notes. Or you can play a straight E chord and ignore the melody notes – it's up to you.

    See my sheet music for the guitar tab.

     1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  5  +  6  +  7  +  8  + -->

## Other riffs and fills

### Verse melody

If you want to emulate the vocal melody with your guitar while staying in the open E and open A positions, focus on these notes. You can strum along if you're able to do so (though that's a bit trickier).

    See my sheet music for the guitar tab.
