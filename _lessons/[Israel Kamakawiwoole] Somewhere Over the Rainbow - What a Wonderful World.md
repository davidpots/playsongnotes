## Capo 5th Fret

To play this song on guitar (and be in the same key as the Iz version, so that you can play along) you'll need a capo on the 5th fret while using the chords above. If you don't have a capo, you can still use the chords above and play the song -- though you couldn't properly play along with the album version since you'd be in a different key.

## How to play the guitar chords

Here is how you play the guitar chords used in this song. It is worth noting that this song is originally performed on a ukulele, which only has four strings. As appropriate, I'm taking the same chords used on the ukulele and showing how to play them on the guitar.

    e-|---3---0---2---0----0----0----2---
    B-|---0---1---3---0----3----1----0---
    G-|---0---0---2---0----0----2----2---
    D-|---0---2---0---2----2----2----1---
    A-|---2---3-------2----2----0----2---
    E-|---3-----------0----0-------------
          G   C   D   Em  Em7   Am   B7

If you want to get a bit more in depth with the guitar chords, I should note a few optional variations you can include as you see fit. In the verses, most of the D-chords would more properly be a Bm7 or the D/F# variation. Note that in the refrain sections, the D-chords return to the typical "normal" D chord I show above. Above all, it is up to you to play what you desire and see fit -- I just wanted to make this note for the sake of being complete.

    e-|-----2------2-----
    B-|-----3------3-----
    G-|-----2------2-----
    D-|-----4------4-----
    A-|------------2-----
    E-|------------------
           D/F#   Bm7
