## Lyrics w/ chords

    INTRO
        A  E  F#m  D     A  E  D-riff

    VERSE
        A             E     F#m           D
        ...Train roll on..... on down the line, won’t you
        A                 E       D-riff
        ...Please take me far... away
        A                     E      F#m           D
        ...Now, feel the wind blow..... outside my door, means I’m
        A                 E           D-riff
        ...I’m leaving my woman... at home... lord and...

    CHORUS
            A            G             D
            ...Tuesday’s gone with the wind
            A            E             D-riff
            ...My baby’s gone with the wind

        And I don’t know... oh, where I’m going
        I just want to be... left alone
        Well, when this train ends... I’ll try again, alright
        I’m leaving my woman... at home... (lord, and...)

            A            G             D

            ...Tuesday’s gone with the wind
            A            E             D-riff
            ...My baby’s gone with the wind

        Train roll on... many miles from my home, see I’m...
        I’m riding my blues... away... yeah...
        Tuesday, you see... she had to be free, all but...
        Somehow I got to... carry on... lord, and...

            [chorus, solo, end]

## Chords you'll need

You'll need these five chords to play this song. The F#-minor is certainly the trickiest of the bunch, as you'll have to barre your left-hand index finger across the entire 2nd fret (from there, use your left hand's ring and pinky fingers to play the 4th fret notes).

    E –––0––––0––––2––––2––––3––––
    B –––2––––0––––2––––3––––0––––
    G –––2––––1––––2––––2––––0––––
    D –––2––––2––––4––––0––––0––––
    A –––0––––2––––4–––––––––2––––
    E ––––––––0––––2–––––––––3––––
         A    E   F#m   D    G

## Chord progressions

There are two progressions you'll need for this song, and they're both fairly similar. The intro and verse use the same progression, while the chorus changes it up (but only slightly).

    INTRO & VERSE     "Train roll on..."
                      A . . . . . E . . . . . F#m . . . . . D . . . . .
                      A . . . . . E . . . . . D   . . . . . D . . . . .

    CHORUS            "Tuesday's gone with the wind..."
                      A . . . . . G . . . . . D . . . . . D . . . . .
                      A . . . . . E . . . . . D . . . . . D . . . . .

## Dsus2 riff

You can imitate the sound of the record version of this song by using this simple Dsus2 riff at the end of the intro, verse, and chorus. With your hand in a Dsus2 position (lift your middle finger off the thinnest string), pick the thinnest two strings as shown in this tab. Listen along for reference, and of course refer to my video lesson for an example.

    E –––0–––|––––––0––––––––0––––––––0––––––––0–––––
    B –––3–––|––––––––3––––––––3––––––––3––––––––3–––
    G –––2–––|––(2)––––––(2)––––––(2)––––––(2)–––––––
    D –––0–––|–––0––––––––0––––––––0––––––––0––––––––
    A –––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    E –––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
       Dsus2

A slightly modified version of this riff is as follows, which matches what you can hear the band doing just before the chorus. Note how the note on the high E-string is going up (in pitch) each time it's played.

    E –––0–––|––––––0––––––––2––––––––3––––––––5–––––
    B –––3–––|––––––––3––––––––3––––––––3––––––––3–––
    G –––2–––|––(2)––––––(2)––––––(2)––––––(2)–––––––
    D –––0–––|–––0––––––––0––––––––0––––––––0––––––––
    A –––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    E –––––––|–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
       Dsus2

## Intro melody riff

When playing the intro of the song, I like to imitate the record version's melody by adding these notes between each chord. You can either do this with or without your normal strumming. See my video lesson for reference.

    E ––(0)–––––––––––(0)–––––––––––2–––––––––––2––––0–2––
    B –––2–––2–3–2–––––0––0–2–0–––––2–––––––––––3–––––––––
    G –––2–––––––––––––1––––––––––––2–––––––––––2–––––––––
    D –––2–––––––––––––2––––––––––––4–––––––––––0–––––––––
    A –––0–––––––––––––2––––––––––––4–––––––––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––0––––––––––––2–––––––––––––––––––––
         A             E           F#m          D
