## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Happy to share this my lesson for "Blackbird" by The Beatles, which is of course one of the most classic acoustic songs there is. This has been a much requested song over the last couple years, and I'm happy to finally share my take on it.

No matter your skill level, my video lesson has you covered. For beginners, I'll walk through each section of the song showing simple, 2-finger chord shapes -- giving you the ability to play the entire song without worrying about any of the trickier fingerpicking patterns. This includes an easier way to play the dreaded diminished chord shapes, which are the trickiest part of this song. For more advanced players, I then dive into the fingerpicking pattern using the open 3rd string on all chords -- providing the tabs section by section.

## BONUS VIDEO: Full play-along cover

Here's an additional video lesson available to my Patreon supporters only, where I play two different play-through covers (the entire song, beginning to end). In the first playthrough I use the simple chord shapes (no 3rd string or fingerpicking patterns), and in the second I play the entire song with the full fingerpicking pattern. Both playthroughs are performed at a slower 72 beats per minute, which is slower than the Beatles version (94 bpm) -- which I trust will make the playthroughs easier to follow.
