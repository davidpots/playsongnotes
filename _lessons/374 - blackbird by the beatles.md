<!-- ## Play-along covers

I have an additional video lesson available to my Patreon supporters, where I play two different play-through covers (beginning to end). In the first playthrough I play the entire song using the simple chord shapes (no fingerpicking patterns), and in the second I play the entire song with the full fingerpicking pattern. Both playthroughs are performed at a slower 72 beats per minute, which is slower than the Beatles version (94 bpm) -- which I trust will make the playthroughs easier to follow. -->
