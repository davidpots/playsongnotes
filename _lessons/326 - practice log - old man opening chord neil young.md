## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's an entry in my "practice log" series of videos, where I share with you tips & tidbits as I make my way through tougher sections of certain songs. This specific video will be focusing on "Old Man" by Neil Young -- particularly that opening chord (Dm9), and how to strum it and sound just like Neil. Even given an exact tab, this is by no means an easy feat. As such, I'll share with you here the 5-6 exercises I created for myself when learning this opening chord -- in the likely event they may be helpful to you.

## Watch Neil Young play it live

I have to recommend this video, where you can watch the Neil himself play this song live. Of course, he makes it look so effortless.
