## Editor's notes

Hey there, friends! Lesson today where I return to the 1970 classic "Me and Bobby McGee", and give a deep-dive into the strumming pattern used by Kris Kristofferson... which is very different from the strumming in Janis Joplin's 1971 cover. My previous lesson on this song explores Janis Joplin's approach in detail, but a recent email I got from Patreon supporter Patrick asked about Kristofferson's approach... and I wanted to dive in!

## My Original Lesson Teaching This Song

Here's my video lesson teaching the Janis Joplin approach to this song, in thorough detail. I also made a [4-page song sheet](https://www.musicnotes.com/l/CTtM8) (licensed and legal) which includes lyrics, chords, progressions, tabs, etc.
