## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's a guitar lesson for the recent hit "Memories" by Maroon 5. I'll be focusing specifically on teaching an approachable, easy strum-along version of this song, as opposed to teaching you the precise tab used by Maroon 5's guitarist. The aim here is to turn this into something you pick up and play, in a casual / campfire / laid back sense. I'll explain the chords, teach you the chord progress, and most important dig into the rhythm ("pushing" the 2nd chord of each measure). In the back half I'll dive into some more advanced stuff, looking at a more fleshed out strumming pattern as well as adding percussive hits on beat 2 and 4. I'll be using a capo on the 4th fret.

Here's what I teach in this lesson:

- 0:00 Lesson overview
- 1:10 Chord shapes needed
- 2:55 Chord progression w/ simple strum
- 5:38 Advanced strumming options
- 8:48 Misc tips & farewell

## Maroon 5's version

Here's the official version of the song, if you want to listen or play along... which I recommend! Remember, add a capo to the 4th fret using the chords I show to play along.

## Looking for the tabs to this song?

If you want to take it beyond strumming, here's a lesson I recommend (from Guitar Zero 2 Hero):

                'Cause I can't reach out to call you... but I know I will one day, hey...

                G       D                     Em                Bm
                ...Everybody hurts sometimes, everybody hurts someday, hey hey
                C          G                       C                        D
                ...But everything gon' be alright, go and raise a glass and say, ayy

    CHORUS
        G                  D              Em                 Bm
        Here's to the ones that we got... cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
                   C                 G                      C                D
        'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories... of everything we've been through
        G                 D             Em                Bm
        Toast to the ones here today... toast to the ones that we lost on the way
                   C                 G
        'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories

                There's a time that I remember, when I never felt so lost
                       C               G               C            D
                When I felt all of the hatred, was too powerful to stop
                       G                  D               Em              Bm
                Now my heart feel like an ember, and it's lighting up the dark
                       C                 G                C            D
                I'll carry these torches for you, and you know I never drop... yeah
                G        D                    Em                   Bm
                ...Everybody hurts sometimes, everybody hurts someday, hey hey
                C       G                      C                         D

                   C                 G                      C                D
        'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories... of everything we've been through
        G                 D             Em                Bm
