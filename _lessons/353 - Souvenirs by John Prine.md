## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Today we're looking at Souvenirs by John Prine, a song so many of you have written in & requested over the past few months. This is a song that's brand new to me -- and in this video I'm going to show my real-time process of transcribing the 16-measure intro fingerpicking sequence. Specifically, I'll show how I:

- Figured out what key the song is in (1:17)
- Figured out the chord progression & rhythm (5:16)
- Figured out the alternating bass notes (15:07)
- Figured out the melody notes (29:39)

To clarify, this is not a "lesson" like most of my other videos... because I haven't fully learned this song yet! It'll honestly take me a few weeks of practice to get it fully learned (and I can record a proper lesson then). But again, I captured this first hour of learning it (i.e. writing up the tabs) and wanted to share this with you, in case helpful. If you aren't interested in the transcribing process and only want the PDF chord sheet, you're in luck! I've made that and it's available via the link just above.

One final note, this transcription is based off the version from John Prine's 2000 album "Souvenirs" - where he performed many of his older hits. I learned this version because it only has one guitar, which makes it easier to hear the notes being played. This song was originally written & released in 1972.

## Some of my other John Prine lessons

If you're interested in more John Prine, you're in luck – I have a few of his other songs learned! There are so, so, so many more I want to learn & add to this list, but for now I hope these are helpful.
