## Editor's notes

Hey friends! Here's the lyrics, chords, and chord progressions for the song "Manhattan Island Serenade" -- originally by Leon Russell (1972), but also covered by Vincent Neil Emerson (2020). I haven't made a video lesson yet, but here's an audio recording of me playing the verse and chorus:
