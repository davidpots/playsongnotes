## Chords needed

Without a capo, use these chords:

    E –––0––––3––––1––––1––––
    B –––1––––0––––3––––1––––
    G –––0––––0––––2––––2––––
    D –––2––––0––––0––––3––––
    A –––3––––2––––––––(3)–––
    E ––––––––3––––––––(1)–––
         C    G    Dm   F

With a capo on the 5th fret, you can also use these chords. This lets you avoid the F chord.

    E –––3––––2––––0––––0––––
    B –––0––––3––––1––––1––––
    G –––0––––2––––2––––0––––
    D –––0––––0––––2––––2––––
    A –––2–––––––––0––––3––––
    E –––3–––––––––––––––––––
         G    D    Am   C

## Chord progression for entire song

Repeat this for the entire song. Eight counts per chord!

    C  . . . C  . . . G . . . G . . .
    Dm . . . Dm . . . F . . . F . . .

With a capo on the 5th fret, this becomes:

    G  . . . G  . . . D . . . D . . .
    Am . . . Am . . . C . . . C . . .

## Strumming pattern

Simple pattern:

    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
    D           D     D  U

Advanced pattern:

    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  
    D           D     D  U     U  D     D  U  D  U

## Chorus lyrics w/ chords

For context, here's the chorus with the chords where they belong. See my video lesson for context and a playthrough:

         C
    It's you, babe
                                          G
    And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
                                            Dm
    And I could try to run, but it would be useless, you're to blame
             F
    Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same

## Good luck!
