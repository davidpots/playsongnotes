## Editor's notes

Here's a play-along cover & full song lesson showing you how to play "Gloria" by The Lumineers. I had a blast learning this song – it uses only 4 chords (C G Am F) but the diversity of strumming and nuanced rhythm techniques really makes it fun to play. I'll teach the chords, the progressions, a few different strumming patterns, and explain some of the advanced stuff such as "pushed" chord changes which can be utilized to great effect here. I'll be playing in standard tuning... note, the Lumineers tune down 1/2 step to Eb Ab Db Gb Bb Eb.

## Official Lumineers version

Here's the Lumineers version. Remember, it's tuned down one half step. I used this version quite a bit when practicing strumming -- I'd put this one, mute all the strings on my guitar (with my left hand), and strum along throughout the song trying to stay in time. Given the speed & consistency of the strumming pattern, it's tough to make it through the entire song without a break – but again, training myself to do so helped immensely.
