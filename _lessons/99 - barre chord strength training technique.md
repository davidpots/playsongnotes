## Editor's notes

In this lesson, I'll teach you how to play barre chords using an strength-training exercise I personally used when I first started playing guitar. This technique doesn't allow you to magically avoid hard work, but it does give you a repeatable process & structure that you can use, over time, to slowly build your muscles to be able to play the chords that have stumped you for so long.
