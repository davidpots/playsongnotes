## Editor's notes

Here's how I play a solo acoustic version of Under the Bridge by the Red Hot Chili Peppers - with no capo, and using the easiest chords that are possible. While this isn't exactly how the RHCP play the song, it allows you to avoid some more difficult barre chords (such as the would-be D barre chord needed for the opening intro chord) and keep the song quite approachable. Throw a capo on the 2nd fret, using the chords I show, if you wanna play along with the album version of this song.

## Lyrics w/ chords

    VERSE
    D            A             Bm           F#m  G
    ...Sometimes I feel like I don’t have a part-ner
    D            A           Bm      G
    ...Sometimes I feel like my only friend
           D      A            Bm      F#m  G
    Is the city I live in, the city of An – gels
    D         A       Bm        G    Dmaj7
    Lonely as I am, together we cry

      D            A             Bm          F#m G
    I drive on the streets cause she’s my companion
      D                A               Bm          G
    I walk through the hills cause she knows who I am
        D            A             Bm        F#m G
    She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
          D       A          Bm        G     Dmaj7
    Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

<!-- ## Capo notes

To play along with the Red Hot Chili Peppers version of the song, use these chords with a capo on the 2nd fret. I should also note, this is not how the RHCP play the song –– I'm choosing to play it this way in either to keep it simple (less crazy barre chords).
