## Chords w/ lyrics

    (Capo 1st fret)

    INTRO
        Am . . . F . . . C . . . G . . .   (x4, with "hey!" on G)

    VERSE
        Am           F                      C
        I don't like walking around this old and empty house
        So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear

        The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake
        It's the house telling you to close your eyes

        Some days I can't even dress myself
        It's killing me to see you this way

                              Am        F
            'Cause though the truth may vary, this
            C            G         Am     F          C
            ...Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

    CHORUS
                Am   F   C   G
                ............ Hey!
                ............ Hey!
                ............ Hey!

        There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
        Well, tell her that I miss our little talks

        Soon it will all be over, and buried with our past
        We used to play outside when we were young
        ...and full of life and full of love

        Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
        Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear

            'Cause though the truth may vary, this
            Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore (...hey!)

                Don't listen to a word I say   (...hey!)
                The screams all sound the same (...hey!)
                Though the truth may vary, this
                Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

                ............ Hey!
                ............ Hey!

        (quieter)
        You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
        All that's left is a ghost of you

        Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
        Just let me go, we'll meet again soon

        (louder)
        Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
        I'll see you when I fall asleep (...hey!)

                Don't listen to a word I say   (...hey!)
                The screams all sound the same (...hey!)
                Though the truth may vary, this
                Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

                Don't listen to a word I say   (...hey!)
                The screams all sound the same (...hey!)
                Though the truth may vary, this
                Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

                (quieter)
                Though the truth may vary, this
                Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
                Though the truth may vary, this
                Ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
