## Lyrics w/ chords

    VERSE
                     Am                     F
        That Arizona sky... burning in your eyes
            C                                        G
        You look at me and, babe... I wanna catch on fire
                          Am                      F
        It’s buried in my soul... like California gold
            C                                     G
        You found the light in me that I couldn’t find

    PRE-CHORUS
                        F                                    C
            So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
                  Am                           G
            Every time we say goodbye, baby it hurts

    CHORUS
                         F   G    Am              F    G     C
                When the sun goes down... and the band won't play
                     F          G             C
                I'll always remember us this way

    VERSE #2
                      Am                       F
        Lovers in the night... poets trying to write
           C                                    G
        We don't know how to rhyme, but damn we try
                         Am                           F
        But all I really know... you're where I wanna go
            C                                 G
        The part of me that's you will never die

    PRE-CHORUS
                        F                                     C
            So when I'm all choked up, and I can't find the words
                  Am                           G
            Every time we say goodbye, baby it hurts

    CHORUS
                         F   G    Am              F    G     C
                When the sun goes down... and the band won't play
                      F         G             Bb
                I'll always remember us this way... whoa yeah,

    BRIDGE
                    F
                    I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
                    C               Bb              F               G
                    Oooh, ooooh.... Oooh, ooooh.... Oooh, ooooh.... ohhhh----

    PRE-CHORUS
                        F                                     C
            So when I'm all choked up, and I can't find the words
                  Am                             G
            Every time we say goodbye, baby it hurts

    CHORUS
                         F   G    Am              F    G     C
                When the sun goes down... and the band won't play
                      F         G         Am
                I'll always remember us..... this way, whoa yeah

    OUTRO
                     F    G  Am
            When you look at me
                    F     G     C
            And the whole world fades
                 F        G         (no chord)            F  Bb  F  C
            I'll always remember us............. this way-----..... ohhhhhh

## Chords used

Here's the chord shapes you'll need for this song, shown in their standard positions. The Bb (B-flat) is a bit tricky, but keep on reading and I'll show you some tips.

    E –––0––––0––––1––––3–––       E –––––      E ––6––
    B –––1––––1––––1––––0–––       B ––3––      B ––6––
    G –––0––––2––––2––––0–––       G ––3––      G ––7––
    D –––2––––2––––3––––0–––       D ––3––  or  D ––8––
    A –––3––––0––––3––––2–––       A ––1––      A ––8––
    E –––––––––––––1––––3–––       E –––––      E ––6––
         C    Am   F    G              Bb           Bb

Here are some creative voicings for these chords, some of which are easier than their normal counterparts above. For the F and Bb, for example, you can get by just fine by only playing the middle 4 of the strings (instead of all 6, which is tougher):

    4 string voicings:        3 string voicings:

    E –––––––––––––––         E –––––––––––––––
    B –––1–––3–––6–––         B –––1–––3–––6–––
    G –––2–––4–––7–––         G –––2–––4–––7–––
    D –––3–––5–––8–––         D –––3–––5–––8–––
    A –––3–––5–––8–––         A –––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––         E –––––––––––––––
         F   G   Bb                F   G   Bb

## Chord progressions

Big picture, here's the progressions you'll be playing. For each chord listed below (as well as each "/"), you'll be playing the strumming pattern once. The "/" character means to repeat the prior chord for one measure.

    Verse:        Am    /    F     /    C    /    G    /  x2

    Pre-chorus:   F     /    C     /    Am   /    G    /  x1

    Chorus:       F (G) Am   F (G) C    F    G    C    /  x1

    Bridge:       Bb    /    F     /    C    /    Bb   /    F   /   G    /  x1

## Strumming pattern

For the verse and pre-chorus sections, reference any of the following strumming patterns (based on your ability and preference when it comes to dynamics & volume).

Simple strum:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +         D = down strum
    D       D

Intermediate strum:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +         D = down strum
    D   D   D   D           > = accented strum
    >       >

Full strum:

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +         D = down strum
    D   D   D   D U         U = up strum
    >       >               > = accented strum


## Chorus strumming

There's one part of the song that deviates from the main strumming pattern – which is the very distinctive chorus. Quite simply, you'll only want to do downstrums on the following beats:

    "....Sun goes down.........band won't play..."
    E –––1–––––3––0––––––––––––––1–––––3––0––––(3)–––––––
    B –––1–––––0––1––––––––––––––1–––––0––1––––––––––––––
    G –––2–––––0––2––––––––––––––2–––––0––0––––––––––––––
    D –––3–––––0––2––––––––––––––3–––––0––2––––––––––––––
    A –––3–––––2––0––––––––––––––3–––––2––3––––––––––––––
    E –––1–––––3–––––––––––––––––1–––––3–––––––––––––––––
         F     G  Am             F     G  C
         1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4

With the chorus, you can also get creative. For example, I like to play these voicings on the "When the sun goes down..." part of the song.

    "....Sun goes down.........band won't play..."
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––10–––––8––5––––––––––––––1–––––3––5–––––8––––––––
    G ––10–––––7––5––––––––––––––2–––––4––5––––––––––––––
    D ––10–––––9––7––––––––––––––3–––––5––5––––––––––––––
    A –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
         F     G  Am             F     G  C
         1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4
