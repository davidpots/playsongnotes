## Chord progressions

Here are the three progressions you'll need in order to play this entire song. For the verse, note you'll bounce between the two progressions a few time before moving on to the chorus. See my video lesson for context where I play it through.

### Verse

    "I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean..."
    G . . . . . C/G . G . . . . . C/G .

    "I never sat by the shore, under the sun..."
    Bm . . . C . . . Bm . . . C . . .

### Chorus

    "But here I am, next to you, the sky is more blue..."
    Em . . . Am . . . G . . . Bm . . .
