## Editor's notes

In this video I'll perform a fingerstyle cover of "Remember Me" from Coco, with tabs. This is an "easy" version, in that, after watching many other fingerstyle versions I put this together as the most accessible fingerstyle version I could muster. Note, this is still a tough song to play! But it's the easiest version that still captures the distinct sound of the song, in my opinion. I hope you enjoy!


## Fingerstyle tabs

Here's my arrangement of this song. I put this together based on (1) listening to all versions on the soundtrack, (2) listening to many versions other folks have posted online, and (3) adjusting things to suit my skill level. If this helps you, fantastic! If not, I hope you find what you're looking for!
