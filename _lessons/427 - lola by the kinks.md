## Editor's notes

Hey there, friends! New guitar lesson today showing how to play Lola by The Kinks, from beginning to end. I'll tackle the intro riff, verse, chorus, bridge, and break down the distinctive lead guitar fill heard at the end of each verse. In total, this song uses a moderate number of chords (with some tricky rhythmic bits in the bridge) -- but I'll show you few options on how to approach strumming during the tricky parts. Let's do it!

## Extended Intro & Verse Riff (Lesson #165)

Here's my initial video, which focuses on the instrumental intro & verse riff. This is inspired by Mike Massé's acoustic cover, which is shown below. The tab for this section is included in my 4-page sheet music linked above.

## Mike Massé's Acoustic Cover

[Here is the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWWU5x5RLbI) of YouTuber Mike Massé playing this song. Great cover! This inspired me to learn it. I teach his extended intro riff (or a close-enough version of it) in my video lesson #165, shown above.
