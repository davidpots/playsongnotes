## Editor's notes

Hello friends! New lesson today for the John Prine classic "Angel From Montgomery", from his 1971 debut album. I'll teach you to play the song exactly like John Prine does, but also include some strumming pattern explanations in case you prefer the Bonnie Raitt version (which is a bit easier to pull off). This song only uses 4 chords, all of which are major -- but in typical Prine fashion, he's able to create a song that adds up to far more than the sum of its parts. I'll start with a quick crash-course explanation of things, then get into the usual details on chords, progressions, strumming, and show you some licks & fills to round things out. Finally, I'll end things with a full play-along cover. Thanks to all of you who suggested this song over the past year... I hope you enjoy!
