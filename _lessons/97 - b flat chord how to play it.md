## Editor's notes

In this lesson, I'll explain how to play the B-flat (Bb) chord on guitar. I will show two different barre chord positions you can play it in, explain the easier and harder variations, and show you a few tricks to finally get you over that hump! This was the absolute hardest chord I learned in my first 1-2 years of guitar, and I really want to help in anyway I can to get you over that hump (should you be stuck). Watch and enjoy!
