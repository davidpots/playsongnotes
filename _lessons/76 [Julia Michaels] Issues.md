## Lyrics with chords

    VERSE

            Cadd9            D
        I'm jealous, I'm overzealous...
                 G/B                             Cadd9
        When I'm down, I get real down, when I'm high, I don't come down
              Cadd9            D
        I get angry... baby, believe me
                G/B                                    Cadd9
        I could love you just like that... and I could leave you just as fast

    PRE-CHORUS

            Cadd9        D
        But you don't... judge me...
                      G                            Em
        'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
            Cadd9        D
        No, you don't... judge me
                      G                            Em
        'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

    CHORUS

                     Cadd9                     D
        'Cause I got issues... But you got 'em too
                    G                               Em
        So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
                    Cadd9              D
        Bask in the glory...of all our problems
                  G                                Em
        'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
                    Cadd9    D         
        Yeah, I got issues..... and one of them is how bad I need you
