Hello, friends! Here's a guitar lesson for Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay, the Otis Redding classic from 1968. This one is a ton of fun to play on the guitar, even though you may not think of guitar when you listen to it. I'll teach you to play it using only 7 chords (using only open chords, all of which major). I'll show you a few ways to strum it, including both beginner-friendly and more advanced strums.

For those of you who are looking for a bit of a challenge, I'll also teach you the subtle walk-up and walk-down heard during the verse of Redding's album version — in addition to explaining the rhythm behind the pushed chord changes that give the song's rhythm a bit of distinction. These may take a bit of practice to get comfortable with, but they sound great when used together. Let's jump in!

## Backing Track Available

I made a simple drum backing track for you to use while playing this song. It's available for you to download over on **[my Patreon post for this song]({{page.patreon_lesson_url}})** (look for the attachment at the very bottom of the post). I made two separate backing tracks:

1. One is at 104 beats per minute, which is the tempo heard in Otis Redding's album recording of this song. If you want to play at the exact same speed as him, use this one. This is what's heard in my play-alon cover at the end of my video lesson.

2. The other is slightly slower, paced at 96 beats per minute. If you find Redding's version moves to fast for you, I recommend this track as it'll give you a bit more time to make the chord changes (etc). Once you're comfortable with with this tempo, I'd encourage you to try using the 104bpm track.
