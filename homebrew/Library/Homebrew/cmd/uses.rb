        `uses` [<options>] <formula>

        Show the formulae that specify <formula> as a dependency. When given
        multiple formula arguments, show the intersection of formulae that use
        <formula>.

        By default, `uses` shows all formulae that specify <formula> as a required
        or recommended dependency.

        By default, `uses` shows usage of <formula> by stable builds.
