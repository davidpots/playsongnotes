Start a Homebrew build environment shell\. Uses our years\-battle\-hardened Homebrew build logic to help your \fB\./configure && make && make install\fR or even your \fBgem install\fR succeed\. Especially handy if you run Homebrew in an Xcode\-only configuration since it adds tools like \fBmake\fR to your \fBPATH\fR which otherwise build systems would not find\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-env\fR
Use the standard \fBPATH\fR instead of superenv\'s, when \fIstd\fR is passed
.
.SS "\fBshellenv\fR"
Prints export statements \- run them in a shell and this installation of Homebrew will be included into your \fBPATH\fR, \fBMANPATH\fR and \fBINFOPATH\fR\.

Tap a formula repository\.
.
.P
List all installed taps when no arguments are passed\.
.
.P
With \fIURL\fR unspecified, taps a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS\. Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for \fBbrew tap\fR \fIuser\fR\fB/\fR\fIrepo\fR \fBhttps://github\.com/\fR\fIuser\fR\fB/homebrew\-\fR\fIrepo\fR\.
.
.P
With \fIURL\fR specified, taps a formula repository from anywhere, using any transport protocol that \fBgit\fR handles\. The one\-argument form of \fBtap\fR simplifies but also limits\. This two\-argument command makes no assumptions, so taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub and using protocols other than HTTPS, e\.g\., SSH, GIT, HTTP, FTP(S), RSYNC\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-full\fR
Use a full clone when tapping a repository\. By default, the repository is cloned as a shallow copy (\fB\-\-depth=1\fR)\. To convert a shallow copy to a full copy, you can retap passing \fB\-\-full\fR without first untapping\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-force\-auto\-update\fR
Auto\-update tap even if it is not hosted on GitHub\. By default, only taps hosted on GitHub are auto\-updated (for performance reasons)\.

.
.TP
\fB\-\-list\-pinned\fR
List all pinned taps\.

Remove symlinks for \fIformula\fR from the Homebrew prefix\. This can be useful for temporarily disabling a formula: \fBbrew unlink\fR \fIformula\fR \fB&&\fR \fIcommands\fR \fB&& brew link\fR \fIformula\fR
.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR

Homebrew, like \fBgit\fR(1), supports external commands\.

Instructions for creating your own commands can be found in the docs: \fIhttps://docs\.brew\.sh/External\-Commands\fR
.
.SH "SPECIFYING FORMULAE"
Many Homebrew commands accept one or more \fIformula\fR arguments\. These arguments can take several different forms:
.
.TP
The name of a formula
e\.g\. \fBgit\fR, \fBnode\fR, \fBwget\fR\.
.
.TP
The fully\-qualified name of a tapped formula
Sometimes a formula from a tapped repository may conflict with one in \fBhomebrew/core\fR\. You can still access these formulae by using a special syntax, e\.g\. \fBhomebrew/dupes/vim\fR or \fBhomebrew/versions/node4\fR\.
.
.TP
An arbitrary file or URL
Homebrew can install formulae via URL, e\.g\. \fBhttps://raw\.githubusercontent\.com/Homebrew/homebrew\-core/master/Formula/git\.rb\fR, or from a local path\. It could point to either a formula file or a bottle\. In the case of a URL, the downloaded file will be cached for later use\.
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Note that environment variables must have a value set to be detected\. For example, \fBexport HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT=1\fR rather than just \fBexport HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_ARCH\fR
Linux only: If set, Homebrew will pass the set value to type name to the compiler\'s \fB\-march\fR option instead of using the default (\fB\-march=native\fR)\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN\fR
If set, instructs Homebrew to prefix all download URLs, including those for bottles, with this variable\. For example, \fBHOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN=http://localhost:8080\fR will cause a formula with the URL \fBhttps://example\.com/foo\.tar\.gz\fR to instead download from \fBhttp://localhost:8080/example\.com/foo\.tar\.gz\fR\.

\fBHOMEBREW_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\fR
When using the \fBS3\fR download strategy, Homebrew will look in these variables for access credentials (see \fIhttps://docs\.aws\.amazon\.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli\-chap\-getting\-started\.html#cli\-environment\fR to retrieve these access credentials from AWS)\. If they are not set, the \fBS3\fR download strategy will download with a public (unsigned) URL\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_BOTTLE_DOMAIN\fR
By default, Homebrew uses \fBhttps://homebrew\.bintray\.com/\fR as its download mirror for bottles\. If set, instructs Homebrew to instead use the specified URL\. For example, \fBHOMEBREW_BOTTLE_DOMAIN=http://localhost:8080\fR will cause all bottles to download from the prefix \fBhttp://localhost:8080/\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_BROWSER\fR
If set, Homebrew uses this setting as the browser when opening project homepages, instead of the OS default browser\.
