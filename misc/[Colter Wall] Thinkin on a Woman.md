VERSE
                   E                         B7
    Sweetly takin' his time... drinkin' on a straight rye
                    E                        A
    Chasin' it with red wine... heavy on his troubled mind
                   E                             A
    Sweetly takin' his time... tryin' to make it all right
                  E      A               E       B7     E     
    Thinkin' on a woman... thinkin' on a woman

                       E                  B7
    He's tunin' up the CB... "Can anybody hear me?"
                                 E                     A
    "'Cause I'm headin' down the Number 3... I got deadlines to meet"
                  E                    B7
    Tunin' up his CB... Hopin' it will free me
                  E      A                  E      B7    E
    Thinkin' on a woman... thinkin' on that woman

BRIDGE

        E   /   B7   /   E   A   E   B7   E   /

                      E                               B7
    He's been singin' sad songs... thinkin' how she's long gone
                             E                                    A
    He's treatin' those that love him wrong... he's ornery as the night is long
                      E                               B7
    He's been singin' sad songs... thinkin' how she's long gone
                     E      A                  E      B7    E
    Thinkin' on that woman... thinkin' on that woman

                   E                                B7
    Burnin' up the midnight oil... special brand of big-rig toil
                             E                                     A
    It's enough to make your blood boil... these mountain roads'll prove my foil
                   E                                      B7
    Burnin' up the midnight oil... gonna shuffle off this mortal coil
                  E      A               E       B7    E
    Thinkin' on a woman... thinkin' on a woman
