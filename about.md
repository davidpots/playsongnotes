## PDF downloads

Here's a preview of some of the songs I've written up nicely formatted PDFs for. Download these as you please, and print them out! They're designed to fit well on notebook-sized paper.

If you find these helpful, please consider tossing a few dollars into my Paypal tip jar. It helps me know you're out there and lets me stay focused on this crazy guitar project of mine.
