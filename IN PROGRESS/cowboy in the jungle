VERSE
              G                              Am
    There’s a cowboy in the jungle... and he looks so out of place
             D
    With his shrimp skin boots and his cheap cheroots
            C            D        G
    And his skin just as white as paste
    G                                   Am
    Heading south to Paraguay where the gauchos sing and shout
             D                             C       D       G
    Now he’s stuck in Portobello since his money's all ran out

          G                                     Am
    So he hangs out with the sailors, night and day they’re raising hell
              D                                 C             D           G
    And his original destination’s just another story that he loves to tell
         G                             Am
    With no plans for the future... he still seems in control
           D                                       C        D           G
    From a bronco ride to a ten foot tide he just... had to learn to roll

CHORUS
        C       D          G           C            D      G 
        ...Roll with the punches... he played all-- of his hunches
        C                       G             D
        ...Made the best of whatever came his way
             C         D     G                C       D   Em
        What he lacked in ambition... he made up with intuition
        C                      D            G
        ...Plowin’ straight ahead come what may

    G                                     Am
    Steel band in the distance, and their music floats across the bay
            D                                   C                   D        G
    While American women in moo-moos talk about all the things they did today
               G                                    Am
    And their husbands quack about fishing as they slug those rum drinks down
               D                                                     C    D        G
    Discussing who caught what and who sat on his butt, but it’s the only show in town

                          C        D        G            C        D          G 
        They’re trying to... drink all the punches, they all may lose their lunches
        C                       G                       D
        ...Tryin’ to cram lost years into five or six days
        C          D        G          C          D     Em
        Seems that blind ambition... erased their intuition
        C                      D             G
        ...Plowin’ straight ahead, come what may

BRIDGE
            F              C                    G
            I don’t wanna live on that kind of island
                F             C                   G
            No, I don’t wanna swim in a roped off sea
                         Em                 A
            Too much for me... too much for me
            C                    D                      G
            I gotta be where the wind and the water are free

      G                                    Am
    Alone on the midnight passage, I can’t count the falling the stars
              D                                        C             D      G
    While the southern cross and the satellites, they remind me of where we are
    G                             Am
    Spinning around in circles, living it day to day
              D                                             C        D      G
    And still 24 hours, maybe sixty good years, it’s really not that long a stay

                  C       D        G                  C        D       G 
        We gotta... roll with the punches... learn to play all of our hunches
        C                    G               D
        Make the best of whatever comes your way
            C         D      G                      C         D   Em
        Forget that blind ambition... and learn to trust your intuition
        C                     D             G
        ...Plowin’ straight ahead come what may

ENDING
            G                 D      C      G 
            ....And there’s a cowboy in the jungle
