When you sleep, are you dreaming of me?

Hurts to say, but I'm always awake

If you want me, I'm waiting for you

If you call me, I'll be there

No, I shouldn't, but I can't give up of you


		Kept me crying for so long, my tears have dried

		When I hear your voice, those tears they come back to mind

		So don't call me just to tell me

		You don't love me anymore

		Still it wrecks me 'cause


				I was a lover, I was a friend

				Now I'm only just someone you call

				When it's late enough to forget

				I was a lover, I was a friend

				Now I'm only just someone you call

				When it's late enough to forget


						I was a lover... I was a friend...

						I was a lover... I was your friend

						I was your lover... I was, I was your friend...

						I was your lover... I was your friend
