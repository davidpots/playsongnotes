            Juliet...... the dice was loaded from the start
                  D    A               Bm            G         A    D
            And I bet.... that you exploded into my heart, and I forget
                     G     Bm             G
            ....I forget....... the movie song
            Em                                G                      A      D
            ...When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong?  Juliet...
                                                        [start intro riff on D, play 2x]

        Come up on different streets, both were streets of shame
        Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
        And I dream your dream for you, and now your dream is real
        How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

        When you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
        You can fall for pretty strangers, and the promises they hold
        You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah
        Now you just say, Oh Romeo, yeah you know I used to have a scene with him

            Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
            Said, I love you like the stars above, I’ll love you till I die
            There’s a place for us, you know the movie song
            When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong?  Juliet...

        I can’t do the talk like they talk on the TV
        And I can’t do a love song like the way its meant to be
        I can’t do everything, but I’ll do anything for you
        Can’t do anything except be in love with you

        All I do is miss you and the way we used to be
        All I do is keep the beat, hmmmm, the bad company
        All I do is kiss you through the bars a rhyme
        Juliet I’d do the stars with you anytime

            Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
            Said, I love you like the stars above, I’ll love you till I die
            There’s a place for us, you know the movie song
            When you gonna realize, it was just that the time was wrong?  Juliet...

        A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
        Laying everybody low with the love song that he made
        Finds a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
        Says something like, “you and me babe, how about it?”

        [ repeat one bar each of G - A, over and over, end ]

        You and me babe, how about it?
