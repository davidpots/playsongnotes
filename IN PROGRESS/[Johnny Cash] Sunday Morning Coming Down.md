        G                              C              D                G
Well, I woke up Sunday morning with no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
        G                               Em                          D
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad so I had one more for dessert
       G                               C                                   G       Em
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
       C                  D                C                      D
Then I washed my face and combed my hair ...and stumbled down the steps to meet the day

    G                                     C                D              G
I'd smoked my mind the night before with... cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
      G                                    Em                                     D
But I lit my first and watched a small kid playing playing with a can that he was kicking
       G                                       C                                G         Em
Then I walked across the street and caught the Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken
             C               D                  C                   D                G
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost somewhere, somehow... along the way

        G                      C                                      G
        ...On a Sunday morning sidewalk I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
                                      D                               G
        'Cause there's something in a Sunday that makes a body feel alone
                                     C                                    G
        And there's nothing short of dying that's half as lonesome as the sound
                             D                                  G
        Of the sleeping city sidewalk and Sunday morning coming down

[Use same chords for remaining verse & chorus sections]

In the park I saw a daddy with a laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school and listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed down the street and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

        ...On a Sunday morning sidewalk I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
        'Cause there's something in a Sunday that makes a body feel alone
        And there's nothing short of dying that's half as lonesome as the sound
        Of the sleeping city sidewalk and Sunday morning coming down
