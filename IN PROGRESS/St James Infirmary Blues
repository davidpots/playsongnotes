		       Am              E       Am       Am
		I went down to the St. James Infirmary
		  Am         F    E     E7
		I saw my ba---by there
		         Am           E          Am     Am
		She was laid out on a cold white table
		    F        E         Am     Am
		So cold, so white, so fair

		        Am          E       Am         Am
		Let her go, let her go, god bless her
		Am          F       E    E7
		...Wherever she may be
		        Am          E          Am     Am
		She may search this wide world over
		             F            E        Am   Am
		She'll never find a sweet man like me
