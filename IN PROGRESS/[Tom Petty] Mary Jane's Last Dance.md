She grew up in an Indiana town

Had a good lookin' momma who never was around

But she grew up tall and she grew up right

With them Indiana boys on an Indiana night



Well she moved down here at the age of eighteen

She blew the boys away, it was more than they'd seen

I was introduced and we both started groovin'

She said, "I dig you baby but I got to keep movin'...on, keep movin' on"


		Last dance with Mary Jane

		One more time to kill the pain

		I feel summer creepin' in and I'm

		Tired of this town again


Well, I don't know what I've been told / You never slow down, you never grow old
I'm tired of screwing up, I'm tired of goin' down
I'm tired of myself, I'm tired of this town
Oh my my, oh hell yes / Honey put on that party dress
Buy me a drink, sing me a song, / Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

		[ chorus ]

There's pigeons down in Market Square / She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room / Nightfall will be comin' soon
Oh my my, oh hell yes / You've got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit the last number, I walked to the road

		[ chorus ]
