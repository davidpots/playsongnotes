      E                        E
I was totin' my pack along the dusty Winnemucca road
      E                       E
When along came a semi with a high and canvas-covered load
           A7                         A7
"If you're goin' to Winnemucca, Mack, with me you can ride."
         E                               E
And so I climbed into the cab and then I settled down inside
   B7                               B7
He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand
             E              E                                    (walk up)
And I said, "Listen... I've traveled every road in this here land"

E
I've been everywhere, man... I've been everywhere, man...
A7                                     E
Crossed the desert's bare, man... I've breathed the mountain air, man.
   B7                                                E
Of travel I've a-had my share, man... I've been everywhere

             E
I've been to Reno, Chicago, Fargo, Minnesota, Buffalo, Toronto, Winslow, Sarasota,
A7                                E
Wichita, Tulsa, Ottawa, Oklahoma, Tampa, Panama, Mattawa, La Paloma,
B7                                     E
Bangor, Baltimore, Salvador, Amarillo, Tocopilla, Barranquilla, and Padilla, I'm a killer.
