Capo 4 to play with Willie



VERSE
           C                                           E
    On the road again... just can't wait to get on the road again
                              Dm
    The life I love is making music with my friends
        F                   G           C
    And I can't wait to get on the road again

           C                                    E
    On the road again... going places that I've never been
                             Dm
    Seeing things that I may never see again
        F                   G            C
    And I can't wait to get on the road again

CHORUS

           F                                               C
    On the road again... like a band of gypsies we go down highway
              F                                                        C
    We're the best of friends... insisting that the world keep turning our way
        G        (silence chord)
    And our way...

SOLO

    (use verse chords)

CHORUS

    (repeat same chorus above)

VERSE
                 C                                        E
    ...is on the road again just can't wait to get on the road again
                              Dm
    The life I love is making music with my friends
        F                   G           C
    And I can't wait to get on the road again
