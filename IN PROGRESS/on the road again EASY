       C                                        E
On the road again just can't wait to get on the road again
                          Dm
The life I love is making music with my friends
    F                   G           C
And I can't wait to get on the road again

       F                                               C
On the road again... like a band of gypsies we go down highway
          F                                                        C
We're the best of friends... insisting that the world keep turning our way
    G        (silence chord)
And our way...

          C                                        E
is on the road again just can't wait to get on the road again
                          Dm
The life I love is making music with my friends
    F                   G           C
And I can't wait to get on the road again
