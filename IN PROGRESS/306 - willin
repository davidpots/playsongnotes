Hey friends â€“ here's a new lesson where I teach you how to play Willin' by Little Feat (1972). Half of this song is a rather straightforward key-of-G acoustic classic rock, while the intro & verse utilize chord shapes similar to what you heard in Blackbird to create a distinctive "open" sound. Learning these together can be tricky at times, but rewarding!

I break everything down step by step, in this order:

0:00 Lesson overview
1:44 Chord shapes needed
9:44 Strumming pattern
12:01 Intro riff (step by step)
18:15 Verse, pre-chorus & chorus
26:03 Full playthrough

Here's a preview of the PDF (attached to the bottom of this post):
