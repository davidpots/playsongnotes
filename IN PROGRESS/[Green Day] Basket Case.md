Do you have the time to listen to me whine

About nothing and everything all at once

I am one of those... Melodramatic fools...

Neurotic to the bone... No doubt about it


		Sometimes I give myself the creeps

		Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me

		It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up

		Am I just paranoid? Or am I just stoned


I went to a shrink, to analyze my dreams

She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down

I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore

So quit my whining cause it's bringing her down


Sometimes I give myself the creeps

Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up

Am I just paranoid?, yeah yeah yeah


				Grasping to control, So I better hold on


		[ chorus ]
