## Lyrics with chords

    C         (walk down)   F      F*  F
    ...The red sandstone it fell...
    C                       (walkdown) F      F*  F
    Right smack on top... of Sedona Arabelle
        C
    When John Ford said, "Won't you hop on in?" and the Stagecoach baby
          C                       F            G
    Gonna take you for a spin, oh whoa... whoa whoa...

        C          F                 G
        Hey little Hollywood, you're gone but you're not forgot, you got the
        C                 F                     G
        ...Cash, but your credit's no good, you flipped the script, you shot the plot
                C                           F            G
        And I remember, I remember when the neon used to burn, so bright and pink
        C     F        G [let ring]  C [light picking]
        ......Saturday night,  kinda pink

    [C] ... The blacklist and its [F] hosts... [F*] [F]
    He [C] came down so swift... and you drove him to the [F] coast [F*] [F]
    We're [C] going California but we're all outta work
    I [C] guess that's better than a grave and a hearse, oh [F] whoa... whoa [G] whoa

        [C] Hey little [F] Hollywood, you're [G] gone but, you're not forgot
        You've got the... [C] cash, but your [F] credit's no good
        You [G] flipped the script, and you shot the plot
        And I [C] remember, I remember when the [F] neon used to [G] burn so bright and pink
        [C].... [F] Saturday [G] night, kinda [C] pink [start heavy strumming]

    [C].... the [C] devil's in a [F] rush... [F*] [F]
    [C].... and the duct tape makes you [F] hush... [F*] [F]
    [C] Hey there Sedona, let me cut you a deal
    I'm a [C] little hold over, and I may have to steal your [F] soul... oh [G] whoa

        [C] Hey little [F] Hollywood, you're [G] gone but, you're not forgot
        You've got the... [C] cash, but your [F] credit's no good
        You [G] flipped the script, and you shot the plot
        And I [C] remember, I remember when the [F] neon used to [G] burn so bright and pink
        [no chord] So bright and pink!
        [C].... [F] Saturday [G] night, kinda [C] pink [let final chord ring, end]

## Capo, key, and about my arrangement

The album version of this song is in the key of -----, which isn't friendly with traditional guitar chords. So my lesson & video play through are in the key of C. This lets you use easy chords, while also capturing some of the recognizable riffs -- all without too much of a headache. Put a capo on the ----- fret, using chords in the key of C, to be able to play along with the album version.

## Chord shapes needed

Big picture, you can use the "normal" voicing for C, F, and G to play the song using the chords I'm showing. But for the F especially, I tend to use simpler versions (shown to the right), which mainly focus on the 2nd 3rd and 4th strings. Use whichever voicing you prefer:

    E ––0–––1–––3––                E –––––              E –––––              E –––––            
    B ––1–––1–––0––                B ––1–– <= l.index   B ––1–– <= l.index   B ––1–– <= l.index
    G ––0–––2–––0––                G ––2–– <= l.middle  G ––2–– <= l.middle  G ––2–– <= l.middle
    D ––2–––3–––0––                D ––3–– <= l.ring    D ––3–– <= l.pinky   D ––3–– <= l.ring  
    A ––3–––3–––2––                A –––––              A ––3–– <= l.ring    A ––x––
    E ––––––1–––3––                E –––––              E –––––              E ––1–– <= l.thumb (wrapped)
        C   F   G                      F                    F                    F    

## Modifying the chords to play the recognizable riffs

With the C and F chords, there's a few simple modifications you can do -- which, combined with strumming, will let you capture the vibe/spirit/sound of the album version. With most of these, the main idea is to emphasize the highest (in pitch) note of each chord -- usually done via up-strums. This allows those specific notes to ring out quite loudly. See my video lesson for context:

    E ––––––––––0–––         E ––––––––––––––           E ––––––––––
    B ––1–––3–––1–––         B ––––––0–––1–––           B –––1–––1––
    G ––0–––0–––0–––         G ––2–––2–––2–––           G –––0–––2––
    D ––2–––2–––2–––         D ––3–––3–––2–––           D –––3–––3––
    A ––3–––3–––3–––         A –(3)–(3)–(3)––           A ––(3)–(3)–
    E ––––––––––––––         E ––––––––––––––           E ––––––––––
        C Cadd9 C                F   F*  F                  F**  F   

## Approximating the intro riff

The main idea here is to use the modifications I showed you earlier, combined with your choice of strumming, to emphasize the following treble notes. During the "repeat" sections (which last for ~3 measures each), the ideal is to slowly "build up" your volume until the walk-down (or walk-up) that transitions to the next section. See my video lesson here for reference.

       Repeat...         ...walk down...  ...repeat...    ...walk up...
    E ––0––0––0––0––0––  –––0–––––––––––  ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––
    B ––1––––––––––––––  –––––3––1––3–––  ––––––––––––––  ––0––0––1––1––
    G ––0––––––––––––––  –––––––––––––––  ––2––2––2––2––  ––2–––––––––––
    D ––2––––––––––––––  –––––––––––––––  ––3–––––––––––  ––3–––––––––––
    A ––3––––––––––––––  –––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––  –––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––
        C                  Cadd9            F               F*    F

The same thing typed more literally (with the pulsing bass notes), but without chord context, would be this. The important thing to consider is putting your left hand in the chord positions (for the C and F) during each measure, even though you're only playing a couple of the strings.

       Repeat...            ...walk down...        ...repeat...        ...walk up...
    E ––0–––0–––0–––0––––  ––0––––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––––––  –––––––––––––––––––
    B –––––––––––––––––––  ––––––3–––1–––3––––  ––––––––––––––––––  ––0–––0–––1–––1––––
    G –––––––––––––––––––  –––––––––––––––––––  ––2–––2–––2–––2–––  –––––––––––––––––––
    D –––––––––––––––––––  –––––––––––––––––––  ––––3–––3–––3–––3–  ––––3–––3–––3–––3––
    A ––––3–––3–––3–––3––  ––––3–––3–––3–––3––  ––––––––––––––––––  –––––––––––––––––––
    E –––––––––––––––––––  –––––––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––––––  –––––––––––––––––––
        C                    Cadd9                F                   F*      F

## Strumming

I like to use either of these two patterns:
