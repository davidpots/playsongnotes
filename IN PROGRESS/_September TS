Do you remember...... the 28th night
      F       C                G
Of September......... love was changin' the minds
      F        C         G                     F    C     G
Of pretenders........ or chasing the clouds away

                F        C           G
Our hearts were ringing...... in the key that our souls
     F          C                   G
Were singing................. as we danced in the night
  F             C                     G                        F  C  G
Remember..................... how the stars stole the night away

    (no chord)
    Ah ah ah...

    F      C       G
    Ahhhhh-------- say that you remember
    F      C       G
    Ahhhhh-------- dancing in September
    F      C       G
    Ahhhhh-------- never was a cloudy day
