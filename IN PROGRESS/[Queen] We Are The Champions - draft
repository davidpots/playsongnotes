I've taken my bows... and my curtain calls
You brought me fame & fortune & everything that goes w/ it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses... no pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose... (and I need just go!)
On... and on... and on... and on

		We are the champions, my friends
		And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
		We are the champions... we are the champions
		No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions
		......of the world

		(repeat chorus as desired)
