        G
Well, I woke up Sunday morning
        C              D                G
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
        G                               Em
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
                          D
So I had one more for dessert
       G                               C
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
                             G       Em
And found my cleanest dirty shirt

           C                  D
    Then I washed my face and combed my hair
      C                      D
    ...And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

    G
I'd smoked my mind the night before
      C                               G
With... cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
      G                                    Em
But I lit my first and watched a small kid playing
                               D
Playing with a can that he was kicking
       G
Then I walked across the street
               C                                G         Em
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken

                 C               D
    And Lord, it took me back to something
             C                   D                G
    That I'd lost somewhere, somehow... along the way

        G                      C
        ...On a Sunday morning sidewalk
                                      G
        I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
                                      D
        'Cause there's something in a Sunday
                                G
        That makes a body feel alone

                                     C
        And there's nothing short of dying
                                       G
        That's half as lonesome as the sound
                             D
        Of the sleeping city sidewalk
                                  G
        And Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing

    And it echoed through the canyons
    Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

        On a Sunday morning sidewalk
        I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
        'Cause there's something in a Sunday
        That makes a body feel alone

        And there's nothing short a' dying
        That's half as lonesome as the sound
        Of the sleeping city sidewalk
        And Sunday morning coming down
