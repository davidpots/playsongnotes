X                           X
All I ever wanted to do was fly
X                                   X
Leave this world and live in the--- sky
           X                      X
I left the C130 out of Fort Worth town
      X                               X
I go up some days I don't wanna come--- down
       X                         X
Well I fly that plane called the Angel Flight
X                                 X
Come on brother you're with me tonight
        X                       X
Between Heaven and earth you're never alone
       X                                   X          X
On the Angel Flight... come on brother I'm taking you home

(start intro on "home")

  X                                X
I love my family and I love this land
    X                                  X
But tonight this flight's for another---- man
   X                                   X
We do what we do because we heard the call
X
Some gave a little, but he gave it all
I fly that plane called the Angel Flight
Come on brother you're with me tonight
Come on brother you're with me tonight
Between Heaven and earth you're never alone
On the Angel Flight
Come on brother I'm taking you home
Come on brother I'm taking you home
Well, the cockpit's quiet and the stars are bright
Feels kinda like church in here tonight
It don't matter where we touch down
On the Angel Flight its sacred ground
I fly that plane called the Angel Flight
Gotta hero riding with us tonight
Between Heaven and earth you're never alone
On the Angel Flight
Come on brother I'm taking you home
Come on brother I'm taking you home
Come on brother I'm taking you home
Come on brother I'm taking you home
