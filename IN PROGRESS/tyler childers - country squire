Country Squire
----


Well tonight I'm up in Chillicothe

Downwind from the papermill

I'm out here spittin' on the sidewalk

Taking in the factory smells

Heaven knows, she tends to smokin' out the window

In the air that gas pipe leak

I wonder if she's cringin' at the same time

Thinking pretty thoughts of me


    I was up for hours this mornin'

    Pullin' traps 'ore I said goodbye

    I plan to tan myself a fox hide

    And hang it on the darlin' bride

    'Cause they tell me that it's gonna be a big one

    And the snow is settin' in

    And I don't want her cold while I ain't at home

    The way that I have been


        Spendin' my nights in a bar room, Lord

        Turnin' them songs into two-by-fours

        Dreamin' 'bout the day that I'm sittin' by the fire

        Huddled with my honey in her Country Squire
