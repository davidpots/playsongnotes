## What members are saying

<p class="testimonial">You have the very best tabs on the net! Easy to follow, logically designed, complete with all information. That's why I'm a supporter!<br /><br />‚Äì Jimbo</p>

<p class="testimonial">Thank you David for the most excellent guitar lessons. I am getting old now and my guitar is a new and awesome instrument that gives me peace in our troubled world. Your contribution and dedication to your lessons provides me with hours of learning in an easy fun style. I am blessed to have been able to support you on Patreon and have access to everything you put out there.<br /><br />‚Äì Harvey</p>

<p class="testimonial">I've seen more guitar instructional videos on the web than I can count but but no one does a better job of explaining and simplifying a song as you do, with the added bonus of a downloadable PDFs. I just got back into playing acoustic guitar last year after a hiatus of too many decades. Keep up the good work you do for all us beginners, re-beginners and not so beginners.<br /><br />‚Äì David</p>

<p class="testimonial">Thank you üôè you are a wonderful teacher as well as a fabulous musician not often do you get both in the same package.<br /><br />‚Äì Eileen</p>

<p class="testimonial">I have just picked up the guitar after 30 years of saying 'I would love to learn that'. Out of all the lessons I have come across online yours are the best. You have a way of making the song sound close to the original and making it pretty easy to learn as a beginner to learn. I could not keep watching the lessons without donating something because learning the guitar takes time and devotion. You deserve to get something back for all you put in. I have subscribed to your channel, and I have never subscribed to anything online. I wish you all the best and hope you have continued success.<br /><br />‚Äì Joshauh</p>

<p class="testimonial">I enjoy your lessons and teaching style. They are practical and I love that you break things down in an easy to understand way. Also your lessons are fun! :) I'm a happy supporter and thank you for providing great service and your musical gift.<br /><br />‚Äì Tangie</p>

<p class="testimonial">I‚Äôve tinkered with the guitar since I was a teenager but never really committed to practicing it. I could never find the passion or the structure from a teacher to keep me at it. I have a full time job and kids...and life is busy. Almost two years ago, I broke my ankle playing baseball and dusted off the guitar. I stumbled across your lesson Say It Ain‚Äôt So by Weezer. I was completely sold. I decided to become a patreon supporter of yours. Tonight, I was just completely compelled to send you a message. Your lessons, teaching, PDF‚Äôs...you name it...Are pure quality. You come across as passionate about your work and it truly makes a difference. Anyway. I hope you and your family are staying healthy and safe during these times. I wish you all best. Thank you for the lessons and I also hope that your site becomes so successful that you can just do this full time. No response necessary. Just reaching out to say I wish lots of good karma to go your way! Cheers!<br /><br />‚Äì Jason</p>

<p class="testimonial">You are such an amazing teacher! You describe steps in detail that is so necessary for beginners like me. Thank you for all that you do!<br /><br />‚Äì Cara</p>

<p class="testimonial">Man, you're the best out there and the way you break things down with printables along with the different camera angles helps me in ways I can't put into words. It's truly a pleasure to be a Patreon supporter of yours!<br /><br />‚Äì BB</p>

<p class="testimonial">You are the very best on the web for teaching how to play a particular song down to the details that deliver a truly professional sounding version. I love it!<br /><br />‚Äì Nick</p>
