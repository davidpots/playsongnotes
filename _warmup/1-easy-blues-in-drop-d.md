## Simple blues riff

After tuning your thickest string down from an E to D, start with these foundational riffs. Accent the 1st and 3rd counts in each 4-count sequence.

    E –––––––––––––––    –––––––––––––––     –––––––––––––––      
    B –––––––––––––––    –––––––––––––––     –––––––––––––––      
    G –––––––––––––––    –––––––––––––––     –––––––––––––––      
    D –––––––––––––––    –––––––––––––––     –––––––––––––––      
    A ––0–––0–2–––2––    ––5–––5–7–––7––     ––7–––7–9–––9––   
    D ––0–––0–0–––0––    ––5–––5–5–––5––     ––7–––7–7–––7––      
        D                  G                   A                

And for each chord below, play the corresponding riff one time. E.g., begin by playing the D sequence four times in a row, then move to the G sequence four times in a row (etc).

    D  D  D  D     G  G  G  G     A  A  G  G     D  D  A  A

## Jack Johnson-style riff

Very similar is this riff, which I demonstrate in the video. Here, you'll only press your additive finger down on the 3rd count of each sequence (and be sure to accent that count). Also, there's a transitional walkdown sequence that is used when going from the A to the G (which I mark as "A*"). Watch my video for context.

    E ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––          
    B ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––          
    G ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––          
    D ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––  ––––––––––––––          
    A ––0––0––2––0––  ––7––7––9––7––  ––7––7––6––6––  ––5––5––7––5––       
    D ––0––0––0––0––  ––7––7––7––7––  ––7––7––6––6––  ––5––5––5––5––          
        D               A               A*              G             

And for each chord below, play the corresponding riff one time. E.g., begin by playing the D sequence four times in a row, then move to the G sequence four times in a row (etc).

    D  D  D  D     A  A  A  A*    G  G  G  G    D  D  A  A

## How to practice these

First, understand these foundational chord positions we'll be using. 5th and 6th strings only for all three chords. For the G and the A, use your left index finger to barre the 5th and 6th strings on either the 5th fret (for the G chord) or the 7th fret (for the A) chord. See my video lesson for a demonstration.

    E ––––––– ––––––– –––––––
    B ––––––– ––––––– –––––––
    G ––––––– ––––––– –––––––
    D ––––––– ––––––– –––––––
    A –––0––– –––5––– –––7–––
    D –––0––– –––5––– –––7–––
         D       G       A

Next, the idea is to add a single note on top of the existing chord positions you know -- and to get comfortable going back & forth between the main chord position, and the with-added-note chord position. For the D, you'll want to add a single finger on the 2nd fret of the 5th fret (left index is fine). For the G and the A, you'll want to use your left ring finger to play the additional note -- while your left index is barring the 5th or 7th fret. Again, see my video lesson for a demonstration.

    E –––––––––– –––––––––– ––––––––––
    B –––––––––– –––––––––– ––––––––––
    G –––––––––– –––––––––– ––––––––––
    D –––––––––– –––––––––– ––––––––––
    A –––0––2––– –––5––7––– –––7––9–––
    D –––0––0––– –––5––5––– –––7––7–––
         D          G          A   

Once you have this worked out, you'll be able to tackle the riffs shown above. Good luck!
