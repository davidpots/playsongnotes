## Editor's notes

Here's three quick trio of exercises you can play, all of which are using triads for the chords of A, D, and E. Focused only on the thinnest 3 strings, I quite enjoy exploring how I can put these mini chord shapes together to come up with something fun. Tabs for each exercise are below, and be sure to check out the charts & tabs I've written up in order to grok how these triad shapes can in fact be used up & down the fretboard. I hope you enjoy! - David Potsiadlo (March 29, 2019)

## Exercise #3

Inspired by "Jack and Diane" by John Mellencamp. Note, on this one you have some flourish notes that are added to the base triads (marked with a \*). I always play these with my left pinky.

    E ||––5–––5–5–––7–––5––|––4–––4–4–4–––4–4––|––2–––2–2–––4––5–4––|–

## Chord shapes for exercise #1

For the A, you don't need to barre the 9th fret (as I show here). But, I find it helpful to be able to do this – so I'll practice using that technique when playing this shape. If you don't want to barre, just use your normal D-major xx0232 left-hand finger positions (moved up to the 9th & 10th frets).

    E –––9––  <= left index (barred)    E ––10––  <= left index (barred)    E ––12––  <= left pinky
    B ––10––  <= left middle            B ––10––  <= left index (barred)    B ––9–––  <= left index (barred)
    G –––9––  <= left index (barred)    G ––11––  <= left middle            G ––9–––  <= left index (barred)
    D ––––––                            D ––––––                            D ––––––                        
    A ––––––                            A ––––––                            A ––––––                        
    E ––––––                            E ––––––                            E ––––––                        
        A                                   D                                   E

## Chord shapes for exercise #2

As I show in the video, if you want to be advanced you can keep your index finger barred (thinnest 3 strings) for all of these chords. It's a bit tougher to learn, but again - I think it makes the transitions a bit easier if you can get a hang of it.

    E –––9––  <= left index (barred)    E ––7––  <= left index    E ––5––  <= left index
    B ––10––  <= left middle            B ––9––  <= left pinky    B ––7––  <= left pinky
    G –––9––  <= left index (barred)    G ––9––  <= left ring     G ––7––  <= left ring
    D ––––––                            D –––––                   D –––––                        
    A ––––––                            A –––––                   A –––––                        
    E ––––––                            E –––––                   E –––––                        
        A                                   E                         D

## Chord shapes for exercise #3

Same old stuff! Notice how all these shapes have already been taught via the prior two exercises.

    E ––5––  <= left index (barred)    E ––4––  <= left index (barred)    E ––2––  <= left index (barred)      
    B ––5––  <= left index (barred)    B ––5––  <= left middle            B ––3––  <= left middle            
    G ––6––  <= left middle            G ––4––  <= left index (barred)    G ––2––  <= left index (barred)    
    D –––––                            D –––––                            D –––––                            
    A –––––                            A –––––                            A –––––                            
    E –––––                            E –––––                            E –––––                            
        A                                  E                                  D
