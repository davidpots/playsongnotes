## Editor's notes

In this lesson I'll show you one of my go-to warmup exercises from the past few years, which involves playing the E-major with the thinnest four strings – and adding flourish with your left pinky and ring finger. This takes an otherwise familiar & common chord, and mixes it up a bit: you're getting a slight less full sound (from only playing 4 strings), but you benefit from having a few extra fingers to add meldoic flourish notes with. I'll show it all to you: the chord shapes, the riff, the strumming, including in tab. I hope you enjoy.

I should note, this is based on the background lead guitar part Father John Misty song "I'm Writing a Novel" – which is track 4 from his great album "Fear Fun".
