## Editor's notes

In this lesson, I'll show you a fun little 3-chord warmup exercise using the E-Bsus4-Asus2. This is inspired by the opening chords to "Angel Flight" by Radney Foster, which I began learning at patron request... the opening measures were quite fun to learn, so I thought I'd turn them into this bite-sized lesson. I'll teach the chords, explain the strumming pattern, and then expand things by showing an alternate voicing you can do if you want to remix things a bit. I hope you enjoy!

## Chords

Note that the "B" is technically a Bsus4, and the A is technically an Asus2. I'll just refer to them as A and B to keep things simple. The idea is we're leaving the thinnest two strings open, in order to keep things simpler and give a more distinctive sound.

    E –––0–––0–––0––– –––0–––0–––0–––
    B –––0–––0–––0––– –––0–––0–––0–––
    G –––1–––4–––2––– –––9–––8–––6–––
    D –––2–––4–––2––– –––9–––9–––7––– <== left ring finger stays on this
    A –––2–––2–––0––– –––7–––––––––––     string on all 6 of these chords!
    E –––0––––––––––– –––0–––––––––––
         E   B   A       E   B   A

## Ending riff

    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B ––––––––––––––9–––––––––
    G –––––––9––11––––11–––9––
    D –––/11–––––––––––––––––– <== left ringer plays this 11th fret note...
    A ––––––––––––––––––––––––     use that as your starting anchor point
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––     After this riff, resolve to any E chord.
