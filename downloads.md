## UPDATE: May 6, 2021

Quick heads up! The educational PDFs for my "song" lessons will be temporarily unavailable. This is because of some copyright issues I'm in the middle of working my way through. I'm actively working to reach an arrangement with the rights holders, so they can be properly credited & compensated. Fortunately, the all of my non-song PDFs remain available -- and 100% my video lessons remain available on this site and my YouTube channel.

üëâ For more about the copyright situation, [check out this update](https://www.patreon.com/posts/quick-audio-50243544) I posted on Patreon (no login required). Thanks!

<p>Support me on Patreon ($3/month, cancel anytime) to get access to the growing catalog of 200+ educational PDFs I‚Äôve been creating since August 2018. I have been adding ~1-2 new lessons a week (video and PDF).</p>

<p>Annual plans are also available (which saves you 15%). Thanks for supporting me and this project, it means a lot!</p>

## What members are saying

<p class="testimonial">You have the very best tabs on the net! Easy to follow, logically designed, complete with all information. That's why I'm a supporter!<br /><br />‚Äì Jimbo</p>

<p class="testimonial">Thank you David for the most excellent guitar lessons. I am getting old now and my guitar is a new and awesome instrument that gives me peace in our troubled world. Your contribution and dedication to your lessons provides me with hours of learning in an easy fun style. I am blessed to have been able to support you on Patreon and have access to everything you put out there.<br /><br />‚Äì Harvey</p>

<p class="testimonial">I've seen more guitar instructional videos on the web than I can count but but no one does a better job of explaining and simplifying a song as you do, with the added bonus of a downloadable PDFs. I just got back into playing acoustic guitar last year after a hiatus of too many decades. Keep up the good work you do for all us beginners, re-beginners and not so beginners.<br /><br />‚Äì David</p>

<p class="testimonial">Thank you üôè you are a wonderful teacher as well as a fabulous musician not often do you get both in the same package.<br /><br />‚Äì Eileen</p>

<p class="testimonial">I have just picked up the guitar after 30 years of saying 'I would love to learn that'. Out of all the lessons I have come across online yours are the best. You have a way of making the song sound close to the original and making it pretty easy to learn as a beginner to learn. I could not keep watching the lessons without donating something because learning the guitar takes time and devotion. You deserve to get something back for all you put in. I have subscribed to your channel, and I have never subscribed to anything online. I wish you all the best and hope you have continued success.<br /><br />‚Äì Joshauh</p>

<p class="testimonial">I enjoy your lessons and teaching style. They are practical and I love that you break things down in an easy to understand way. Also your lessons are fun! :) I'm a happy supporter and thank you for providing great service and your musical gift.<br /><br />‚Äì Tangie</p>

<p class="testimonial">I‚Äôve tinkered with the guitar since I was a teenager but never really committed to practicing it. I could never find the passion or the structure from a teacher to keep me at it. I have a full time job and kids...and life is busy. Almost two years ago, I broke my ankle playing baseball and dusted off the guitar. I stumbled across your lesson Say It Ain‚Äôt So by Weezer. I was completely sold. I decided to become a patreon supporter of yours. Tonight, I was just completely compelled to send you a message. Your lessons, teaching, PDF‚Äôs...you name it...Are pure quality. You come across as passionate about your work and it truly makes a difference. Anyway. I hope you and your family are staying healthy and safe during these times. I wish you all best. Thank you for the lessons and I also hope that your site becomes so successful that you can just do this full time. No response necessary. Just reaching out to say I wish lots of good karma to go your way! Cheers!<br /><br />‚Äì Jason</p>

<p class="testimonial">You are such an amazing teacher! You describe steps in detail that is so necessary for beginners like me. Thank you for all that you do!<br /><br />‚Äì Cara</p>

<p class="testimonial">Man, you're the best out there and the way you break things down with printables along with the different camera angles helps me in ways I can't put into words. It's truly a pleasure to be a Patreon supporter of yours!<br /><br />‚Äì BB</p>

<p class="testimonial">You are the very best on the web for teaching how to play a particular song down to the details that deliver a truly professional sounding version. I love it!<br /><br />‚Äì Nick</p>

## Prefer to buy the PDFs individually?

I currently don't sell any of my PDFs for individual purchase -- but maybe I will one day in the future. <a href="mailto:play.songnotes@gmail.com">Shoot me an email</a> if this is something you're theoretically interested in. I can't promise anything, but it's always helpful for me to understand what my audience is looking for as possible alternatives to supporting me monthly via Patreon. Thanks!
