# How to Get My Instructional PDFs & Song Sheets

<p class="font-size--large">Guitar can be complicated to learn! While my free video lessons will get you started in learning songs or techniques, I believe there is immense value in print-friendly diagrams that you can reference alongside my video lessons. I take great pride in creating diagrams to explain the concepts behind strumming patterns, fretboard & chord charts, scales, tablature, and more.</p>

<p class="font-size--large">I offer two types of premium printable content:</p><br />

## Instructional PDFs (non-songs)

Approximately half my video lessons teach general guitar techniques: tips, quick riffs & exercises, practical music theory, and more. These are meant to get you up-to-speed with universal concepts used in countless songs. With each of these instructional videos, I make a PDF to accompany the video lesson. Each PDF is print-friendly, and typically between 2 and 5 pages. Here's what they look like (showing the first page only):

## Patreon is the best way to support me and my lessons!

Many folks have asked what‚Äôs the best way to support me and this project ‚Äì and the answer: become a member on Patreon. The cost is $5 per month (cancel anytime) or via annual pledge (save ~15%) ‚Äì¬†most of which goes directly to me. These lessons are a labor of love, but make no mistake ‚Äì they take a lot of work to create! It‚Äôs my dream to one day work on this project full time ‚Äì and the key to making that happen is your support.

## What members are saying

<p class="testimonial">You have the very best tabs on the net! Easy to follow, logically designed, complete with all information. That's why I'm a supporter!<br /><br />‚Äì Jimbo</p>

<p class="testimonial">Thank you David for the most excellent guitar lessons. I am getting old now and my guitar is a new and awesome instrument that gives me peace in our troubled world. Your contribution and dedication to your lessons provides me with hours of learning in an easy fun style. I am blessed to have been able to support you on Patreon and have access to everything you put out there.<br /><br />‚Äì Harvey</p>

<p class="testimonial">I've seen more guitar instructional videos on the web than I can count but but no one does a better job of explaining and simplifying a song as you do, with the added bonus of a downloadable PDFs. I just got back into playing acoustic guitar last year after a hiatus of too many decades. Keep up the good work you do for all us beginners, re-beginners and not so beginners.<br /><br />‚Äì David</p>

<p class="testimonial">Thank you üôè you are a wonderful teacher as well as a fabulous musician not often do you get both in the same package.<br /><br />‚Äì Eileen</p>

<p class="testimonial">I have just picked up the guitar after 30 years of saying 'I would love to learn that'. Out of all the lessons I have come across online yours are the best. You have a way of making the song sound close to the original and making it pretty easy to learn as a beginner to learn. I could not keep watching the lessons without donating something because learning the guitar takes time and devotion. You deserve to get something back for all you put in. I have subscribed to your channel, and I have never subscribed to anything online. I wish you all the best and hope you have continued success.<br /><br />‚Äì Joshauh</p>

<p class="testimonial">I enjoy your lessons and teaching style. They are practical and I love that you break things down in an easy to understand way. Also your lessons are fun! :) I'm a happy supporter and thank you for providing great service and your musical gift.<br /><br />‚Äì Tangie</p>

<p class="testimonial">I‚Äôve tinkered with the guitar since I was a teenager but never really committed to practicing it. I could never find the passion or the structure from a teacher to keep me at it. I have a full time job and kids...and life is busy. Almost two years ago, I broke my ankle playing baseball and dusted off the guitar. I stumbled across your lesson Say It Ain‚Äôt So by Weezer. I was completely sold. I decided to become a patreon supporter of yours. Tonight, I was just completely compelled to send you a message. Your lessons, teaching, PDF‚Äôs...you name it...Are pure quality. You come across as passionate about your work and it truly makes a difference. Anyway. I hope you and your family are staying healthy and safe during these times. I wish you all best. Thank you for the lessons and I also hope that your site becomes so successful that you can just do this full time. No response necessary. Just reaching out to say I wish lots of good karma to go your way! Cheers!<br /><br />‚Äì Jason</p>

<p class="testimonial">You are such an amazing teacher! You describe steps in detail that is so necessary for beginners like me. Thank you for all that you do!<br /><br />‚Äì Cara</p>

<p class="testimonial">Man, you're the best out there and the way you break things down with printables along with the different camera angles helps me in ways I can't put into words. It's truly a pleasure to be a Patreon supporter of yours!<br /><br />‚Äì BB</p>

<p class="testimonial">You are the very best on the web for teaching how to play a particular song down to the details that deliver a truly professional sounding version. I love it!<br /><br />‚Äì Nick</p>
